abstract = {An increasing number of theoretical and empirical studies approach the function of the human brain from a network perspective. The analysis of brain networks is made feasible by the development of new imaging acquisition methods as well as new tools from graph theory and dynamical systems. This review surveys some of these methodological advances and summarizes recent findings on the architecture of structural and functional brain networks. Studies of the structural connectome reveal several modules or network communities that are interlinked by hub regions mediating communication processes between modules. Recent network analyses have shown that network hubs form a densely linked collective called a "rich club," centrally positioned for attracting and dispersing signal traffic. In parallel, recordings of resting and task-evoked neural activity have revealed distinct resting-state networks that contribute to functions in distinct cognitive domains. Network methods are increasingly applied in a clinical context, and their promise for elucidating neural substrates of brain and mental disorders is discussed.}

abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and {fMRI} experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.}

abstract = {Neuroanatomy places critical constraints on the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex. To analyze these constraints we have examined the relationship between structural features of networks (expressed as graphs) and the patterns of functional connectivity to which they give rise when implemented as dynamical systems. We selected among structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional connectivity. We selected graphs separately for increases in measures of entropy (capturing statistical independence of graph elements), integration (capturing their statistical dependence) and complexity (capturing the interplay between their functional segregation and integration). We found that dynamics with high complexity were supported by graphs whose units were organized into densely linked groups that were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. Connection matrices based on actual neuroanatomical data describing areas and pathways of the macaque visual cortex and the cat cortex showed structural characteristics that coincided best with those of such complex graphs, revealing the presence of distinct but interconnected anatomical groupings of areas. Moreover, when implemented as dynamical systems, these cortical connection matrices generated functional connectivity with high complexity, characterized by the presence of highly coherent functional clusters. We also found that selection of graphs as they responded to input or produced output led to increases in the complexity of their dynamics. We hypothesize that adaptation to rich sensory environments and motor demands requires complex dynamics and that these dynamics are supported by neuroanatomical motifs that are characteristic of the cerebral cortex.}

Recent applications of network theory and theoretical neuroscience to large-scale brain networks have started to dissolve this mystery. Network analyses suggest that hierarchical modular brain networks are particularly suited to facilitate local (segregated) neuronal operations and the global integration of segregated functions. Although functional networks are constrained by structural connections, context-sensitive integration during cognition tasks necessarily entails a divergence between structural and functional networks. This degenerate (many-to-one) function-structure mapping is crucial for understanding the nature of brain networks. The emergence of dynamic functional networks from static structural connections calls for a formal (computational) approach to neuronal information processing that may resolve this dialectic between structure and function.}

This serial model of sexual differentiation was simple, unifying and seductive. Recent evidence, however, indicates that the linear model is incorrect and that sex differences arise in response to diverse sex-specific signals originating from inherent differences in the genome and involve cellular mechanisms that are specific to individual tissues or brain regions. Moreover, sex-specific effects of the environment reciprocally affect biology, sometimes profoundly, and must therefore be integrated into a realistic model of sexual differentiation. A more appropriate model is a parallel-interactive model that encompasses the roles of multiple molecular signals and pathways that differentiate males and females, including synergistic and compensatory interactions among pathways and an important role for the environment.}

Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topography-the closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function.}

Investigating the distribution of these spatial patterns is an active area of research with the goal of obtaining a better understanding of the neural networks underlying brain function. One intriguing aspect of spontaneous activity is an apparent nonstationarity, or variability of interaction between brain regions. It was recently proposed that spontaneous brain activity may be dominated by brief traces of activity, possibly originating from a neuronal avalanching phenomenon. Such traces may involve different subregions in a network at different times, potentially reflecting functionally relevant relationships that are not captured with conventional data analysis. To investigate this, we examined publicly available functional magnetic resonance imaging data with a dedicated analysis method and found indications that functional networks inferred from conventional correlation analysis may indeed be driven by activity at only a few critical time points. Subsequent analysis of the activity at these critical time points revealed multiple spatial patterns, each distinctly different from the established functional networks. The spatial distribution of these patterns suggests a potential functional relevance.}

One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.}

Network hubs link communities to one another and ensure efficient communication and information integration.

Network studies of structural connectivity obtained from noninvasive neuroimaging have revealed a number of highly nonrandom network attributes, including high clustering and modularity combined with high efficiency and short path length. The combination of these attributes simultaneously promotes high specialization and high integration within a modular small-world architecture. Structural and functional networks share some of the same characteristics, although their relationship is complex and nonlinear.

In the present study, we investigated the dynamic behavior of resting-state connectivity across the course of a single scan, performing a time-frequency coherence analysis based on the wavelet transform. We focused on the connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}), a primary node of the default-mode network, examining its relationship with both the "anticorrelated" ("task-positive") network as well as other nodes of the default-mode network. It was observed that coherence and phase between the {PCC} and the anticorrelated network was variable in time and frequency, and statistical testing based on Monte Carlo simulations revealed the presence of significant scale-dependent temporal variability. In addition, a sliding-window correlation procedure identified other regions across the brain that exhibited variable connectivity with the {PCC} across the scan, which included areas previously implicated in attention and salience processing. Although it is unclear whether the observed coherence and phase variability can be attributed to residual noise or modulation of cognitive state, the present results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static, and it may therefore prove valuable to consider measures of variability, in addition to average quantities, when characterizing resting-state networks.

These inter-regional networks have previously been analyzed in terms of their node degree, structural motif, path length and clustering coefficient distributions. In this paper we focus on the identification and classification of hub regions, which are thought to play pivotal roles in the coordination of information flow. We identify hubs and characterize their network contributions by examining motif fingerprints and centrality indices for all regions within the cerebral cortices of both the cat and the macaque. Motif fingerprints capture the statistics of local connection patterns, while measures of centrality identify regions that lie on many of the shortest paths between parts of the network. Within both cat and macaque networks, we find that a combination of degree, motif participation, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality allows for reliable identification of hub regions, many of which have previously been functionally classified as polysensory or multimodal. We then classify hubs as either provincial (intra-cluster) hubs or connector (inter-cluster) hubs, and proceed to show that lesioning hubs of each type from the network produces opposite effects on the small-world index. Our study presents an approach to the identification and classification of putative hub regions in brain networks on the basis of multiple network attributes and charts potential links between the structural embedding of such regions and their functional roles.}

abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity {MRI}. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex ({MT}+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the {MT}+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.}

abstract = {Human learning is a complex phenomenon requiring flexibility to adapt existing brain function and precision in selecting new neurophysiological activities to drive desired behavior. These two attributes--flexibility and selection--must operate over multiple temporal scales as performance of a skill changes from being slow and challenging to being fast and automatic. Such selective adaptability is naturally provided by modular structure, which plays a critical role in evolution, development, and optimal network function. Using functional connectivity measurements of brain activity acquired from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill, we investigate the role of modularity in human learning by identifying dynamic changes of modular organization spanning multiple temporal scales. Our results indicate that flexibility, which we measure by the allegiance of nodes to modules, in one experimental session predicts the relative amount of learning in a future session. We also develop a general statistical framework for the identification of modular architectures in evolving systems, which is broadly applicable to disciplines where network adaptability is crucial to the understanding of system performance.}

Both structural and functional human brain graphs have consistently demonstrated key topological properties such as small-worldness, modularity, and heterogeneous degree distributions.

abstract = {The brain is expensive, incurring high material and metabolic costs for its size--relative to the size of the body--and many aspects of brain network organization can be mostly explained by a parsimonious drive to minimize these costs. However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a 'rich club' of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.}

The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category.

abstract = {Characterization of large-scale brain networks using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging is typically based on the assumption of network stationarity across the duration of scan. Recent studies in humans have questioned this assumption by showing that within-network functional connectivity fluctuates on the order of seconds to minutes. Time-varying profiles of resting-state networks ({RSNs}) may relate to spontaneously shifting, electrophysiological network states and are thus mechanistically of particular importance. However, because these studies acquired data from awake subjects, the fluctuating connectivity could reflect various forms of conscious brain processing such as passive mind wandering, active monitoring, memory formation, or changes in attention and arousal during image acquisition. Here, we characterize {RSN} dynamics of anesthetized macaques that control for these accounts, and compare them to awake human subjects. We find that functional connectivity among nodes comprising the "oculomotor ({OCM}) network" strongly fluctuated over time during awake as well as anaesthetized states. For time dependent analysis with short windows (\textless 60 s), periods of positive functional correlations alternated with prominent anticorrelations that were missed when assessed with longer time windows. Similarly, the analysis identified network nodes that transiently link to the {OCM} network and did not emerge in average {RSN} analysis. Furthermore, time-dependent analysis reliably revealed transient states of large-scale synchronization that spanned all seeds. The results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static and that {RSNs} can exhibit nonstationary, spontaneous relationships irrespective of conscious, cognitive processing. The findings imply that mechanistically important network information can be missed when using average functional connectivity as the single network measure.

Recently, multivariate machine learning methods have demonstrated the feasibility to predict illness onset in clinically defined at-risk individuals using structural magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) data. However, it remains unclear whether these findings could be replicated in independent populations. {METHODS}: We evaluated the performance of an {MRI}-based classification system in predicting disease conversion in at-risk individuals recruited within the prospective {FePsy} (Früherkennung von Psychosen) study at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Pairwise and multigroup biomarkers were constructed using the {MRI} data of 22 healthy volunteers, 16/21 at-risk subjects with/without a subsequent disease conversion. Diagnostic performance was measured in unseen test cases using repeated nested cross-validation. {RESULTS}: The classification accuracies in the "healthy controls ({HCs}) vs converters," "{HCs} vs nonconverters," and "converters vs nonconverters" analyses were 92.3\%, 66.9\%, and 84.2\%, respectively. A positive likelihood ratio of 6.5 in the converters vs nonconverters analysis indicated a 40\% increase in diagnostic certainty by applying the biomarker to an at-risk population with a transition rate of 43\%. The neuroanatomical decision functions underlying these results particularly involved the prefrontal perisylvian and subcortical brain structures. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings suggest that the early prediction of psychosis may be reliably enhanced using neuroanatomical pattern recognition operating at the single-subject level. These {MRI}-based biomarkers may have the potential to identify individuals at the highest risk of developing psychosis, and thus may promote informed clinical strategies aiming at preventing the full manifestation of the disease.}

Several resting-state functional connectivity {MRI} reports have implicated regions of the default mode system as brain hubs; we demonstrate that previous degree-based approaches to hub identification may have identified portions of large brain systems rather than critical nodes of brain networks. We utilize two methods to identify hub-like brain regions: (1) finding network nodes that participate in multiple subnetworks of the brain, and (2) finding spatial locations in which several systems are represented within a small volume. These methods converge on a distributed set of regions that differ from previous reports on hubs. This work identifies regions that support multiple systems, leading to spatially constrained predictions about brain function that may be tested in terms of lesions, evoked responses, and dynamic patterns of activity.

In this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity ({CN}), that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of significant deviations from independence of large subsets. {CN} is then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical independence for subsets of increasing size. {CN} is shown to be high when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low when the components of a system are either completely independent (segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are associated with high values of {CN}. The approach outlined here may prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.}

Regions of the sensorimotor cortex that were activated secondary to hand movement were identified using functional {MRI} methodology ({FMRI}). Time courses of low frequency (\textless 0.1 Hz) fluctuations in resting brain were observed to have a high degree of temporal correlation (P \textless 10(-3)) within these regions and also with time courses in several other regions that can be associated with motor function. It is concluded that correlation of low frequency fluctuations, which may arise from fluctuations in blood oxygenation or flow, is a manifestation of functional connectivity of the brain.}

For nearly two centuries, proponents of specialized organs or modules of the mind and brain--from the phrenologists to Broca to Chomsky and Fodor--have jousted with the proponents of distributed cognitive and neural processing--from Flourens to Lashley to {McClelland} and Rumelhart. I argue here that research using functional {MRI} is beginning to answer this long-standing question with new clarity and precision by indicating that at least a few specific aspects of cognition are implemented in brain regions that are highly specialized for that process alone. Cortical regions have been identified that are specialized not only for basic sensory and motor processes but also for the high-level perceptual analysis of faces, places, bodies, visually presented words, and even for the very abstract cognitive function of thinking about another person's thoughts. I further consider the as-yet unanswered questions of how much of the mind and brain are made up of these functionally specialized components and how they arise developmentally.}

abstract = {A popular method for investigating whether stimulus information is present in {fMRI} response patterns is to attempt to "decode" the stimuli from the response patterns with a multivariate classifier. The sensitivity for detecting the information depends on the particular classifier used. However, little is known about the relative performance of different classifiers on {fMRI} data. Here we compared six multivariate classifiers and investigated how the response-amplitude estimate used (beta- or t-value) and different pattern normalizations affect classification performance. The compared classifiers were a pattern-correlation classifier, a k-nearest-neighbors classifier, Fisher's linear discriminant, Gaussian naïve Bayes, and linear and nonlinear (radial-basis-function kernel) support vector machines. We compared these classifiers' accuracy at decoding the category of visual objects from response patterns in human early visual and inferior temporal cortex acquired in an event-related design with {BOLD} {fMRI} at {3T} using {SENSE} and isotropic voxels of about 2-mm width. Overall, Fisher's linear discriminant (with an optimal-shrinkage covariance estimator) and the linear support vector machine performed best. The pattern-correlation classifier often performed similarly as those two classifiers. The nonlinear classifiers never performed better and sometimes significantly worse than the linear classifiers, suggesting overfitting. Defining response patterns by t-values (or in error-standard-deviation units) rather than by beta estimates (in \% signal change) to define the patterns appeared advantageous. Cross-validation by a leave-one-stimulus-pair-out method gave higher accuracies than a leave-one-run-out method, suggesting that generalization to independent runs (which more safely ensures independence of the test set) is more challenging than generalization to novel stimuli within the same category. Independent selection of fewer more visually responsive voxels tended to yield better decoding performance for all classifiers. Normalizing mean and standard deviation of the response patterns either across stimuli or across voxels had no significant effect on decoding performance. Overall our results suggest that linear decoders based on t-value patterns may perform best in the present scenario of visual object representations measured for about 60min per subject with {3T} {fMRI}.

This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.

In this state, the functional networks are in a low firing stable state while they are continuously pulled towards multiple other configurations. Small extrinsic perturbations can shape task-related network dynamics, whereas perturbations from intrinsic noise generate excursions reflecting the range of available functional networks. This is particularly advantageous for the efficiency and speed of network mobilization. Thus, the resting state reflects the dynamical capabilities of the brain, which emphasizes the vital interplay of time and space.

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) techniques have contributed significantly to our understanding of brain function. Current methods are based on the analysis of gradual and continuous changes in the brain blood oxygenated level dependent ({BOLD}) signal. Departing from that approach, recent work has shown that equivalent results can be obtained by inspecting only the relatively large amplitude {BOLD} signal peaks, suggesting that relevant information can be condensed in discrete events. This idea is further explored here to demonstrate how brain dynamics at resting state can be captured just by the timing and location of such events, i.e., in terms of a spatiotemporal point process. The method allows, for the first time, to define a theoretical framework in terms of an order and control parameter derived from {fMRI} data, where the dynamical regime can be interpreted as one corresponding to a system close to the critical point of a second order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that the resting brain spends most of the time near the critical point of such transition and exhibits avalanches of activity ruled by the same dynamical and statistical properties described previously for neuronal events at smaller scales. Given the demonstrated functional relevance of the resting state brain dynamics, its representation as a discrete process might facilitate large-scale analysis of brain function both in health and disease.}

abstract = {Most brain activity occurs in an ongoing manner not directly locked to external events or stimuli. Regional ongoing activity fluctuates in unison with some brain regions but not others, and the degree of long-range coupling is called functional connectivity, often measured with correlation. Strength and spatial distributions of functional connectivity dynamically change in an ongoing manner over seconds to minutes, even when the external environment is held constant. Direct evidence for any behavioral relevance of these continuous large-scale dynamics has been limited. Here, we investigated whether ongoing changes in baseline functional connectivity correlate with perception. In a continuous auditory detection task, participants perceived the target sound in roughly one-half of the trials. Very long (22-40 s) interstimulus intervals permitted investigation of baseline connectivity unaffected by preceding evoked responses. Using multivariate classification, we observed that functional connectivity before the target predicted whether it was heard or missed. Using graph theoretical measures, we characterized the difference in functional connectivity between states that lead to hits vs. misses. Before misses compared with hits and task-free rest, connectivity showed reduced modularity, a measure of integrity of modular network structure. This effect was strongest in the default mode and visual networks and caused by both reduced within-network connectivity and enhanced across-network connections before misses. The relation of behavior to prestimulus connectivity was dissociable from that of prestimulus activity amplitudes. In conclusion, moment to moment dynamic changes in baseline functional connectivity may shape subsequent behavioral performance. A highly modular network structure seems beneficial to perceptual efficiency.}

We identified a whole-brain network architecture present across dozens of task states that was highly similar to the resting-state network architecture. The most frequent functional connectivity strengths across tasks closely matched the strengths observed at rest, suggesting this is an "intrinsic," standard architecture of functional brain organization. Furthermore, a set of small but consistent changes common across tasks suggests the existence of a task-general network architecture distinguishing task states from rest. These results indicate the brain's functional network architecture during task performance is shaped primarily by an intrinsic network architecture that is also present during rest, and secondarily by evoked task-general and task-specific network changes. This establishes a strong relationship between resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked functional connectivity-areas of neuroscientific inquiry typically considered separately.

To do this, a univariate model is independently fitted to each connection. It would be unwise to declare significance based on an uncorrected threshold of \alpha=0.05, since the expected number of false positives for a network comprising N=90 nodes and N(N-1)/2=4005 connections would be 200. Control of Type I errors over all connections is therefore necessary. The network-based statistic ({NBS}) and spatial pairwise clustering ({SPC}) are two distinct methods that have been used to control family-wise errors when assessing the evidence for an experimental effect with mass univariate testing. The basic principle of the {NBS} and {SPC} is the same as supra-threshold voxel clustering. Unlike voxel clustering, where the definition of a voxel cluster is unambiguous, 'clusters' formed among supra-threshold connections can be defined in different ways. The {NBS} defines clusters using the graph theoretical concept of connected components. {SPC} on the other hand uses a more stringent pairwise clustering concept. The purpose of this article is to compare the pros and cons of the {NBS} and {SPC}, provide some guidelines on their practical use and demonstrate their utility using a case study involving neuroimaging data.

Thus, network organization fundamentally influences brain disease, and a connectomic approach grounded in network science is integral to understanding neuropathology. Here, we consider how brain-network topology shapes neural responses to damage, highlighting key maladaptive processes (such as diaschisis, transneuronal degeneration and dedifferentiation), and the resources (including degeneracy and reserve) and processes (such as compensation) that enable adaptation. We then show how knowledge of network topology allows us not only to describe pathological processes but also to generate predictive models of the spread and functional consequences of brain disease.}

Identification was successful across scan sessions and even between task and rest conditions, indicating that an individual's connectivity profile is intrinsic, and can be used to distinguish that individual regardless of how the brain is engaged during imaging. Characteristic connectivity patterns were distributed throughout the brain, but the frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive. Furthermore, we show that connectivity profiles predict levels of fluid intelligence: the same networks that were most discriminating of individuals were also most predictive of cognitive behavior. Results indicate the potential to draw inferences about single subjects on the basis of functional connectivity {fMRI}.}

Although these models have the same goal, the way that goal is attained, and the functional architectures required, are fundamentally different. This review describes the differences, in the functional anatomy of sensory cortical hierarchies, implied by the two models. We then consider how neuroimaging can be used to disambiguate between them. The key distinction reduces to whether backward connections are employed by the brain to generate a prediction of sensory inputs. To ascertain whether backward influences are evident empirically requires a characterization of functional integration among brain systems. This review summarizes the approaches to measuring functional integration in terms of effective connectivity and proceeds to address the question posed by the theoretical considerations. In short, it will be shown that the conjoint manipulation of bottom-up and top-down inputs to an area can be used to test for interactions between them, in elaborating cortical responses. The conclusion, from these sorts of neuroimaging studies, points to the prevalence of top-down influences and the plausibility of generative models of sensory brain function.}

Here, we quantify the formation of network modules in a sample of 780 youth (aged 8-22 y) who were studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We demonstrate that the brain's functional network organization changes in youth through a process of modular evolution that is governed by the specific cognitive roles of each system, as defined by the balance of within- vs. between-module connectivity. Moreover, individual variability in these roles is correlated with cognitive performance. Collectively, these results suggest that dynamic maturation of network modules in youth may be a critical driver for the development of cognition.}

abstract = {Several properties of the cerebral cortex, including its columnar and laminar organization, as well as the topographic organization of cortical areas, can only be properly understood in the context of the intrinsic two-dimensional structure of the cortical surface. In order to study such cortical properties in humans, it is necessary to obtain an accurate and explicit representation of the cortical surface in individual subjects. Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical surface, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual intervention. Automated routines for unfolding and flattening the cortical surface are described in a companion paper. These procedures allow for the routine use of cortical surface-based analysis and visualization methods in functional brain imaging. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.}

abstract = {Psychiatric disorders are characterized by major fluctuations in psychological function over the course of weeks and months, but the dynamic characteristics of brain function over this timescale in healthy individuals are unknown. Here, as a proof of concept to address this question, we present the {MyConnectome} project. An intensive phenome-wide assessment of a single human was performed over a period of 18 months, including functional and structural brain connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging, psychological function and physical health, gene expression and metabolomics. A reproducible analysis workflow is provided, along with open access to the data and an online browser for results. We demonstrate dynamic changes in brain connectivity over the timescales of days to months, and relations between brain connectivity, gene expression and metabolites. This resource can serve as a testbed to study the joint dynamics of human brain and metabolic function over time, an approach that is critical for the development of precision medicine strategies for brain disorders.}

abstract = {In this paper, we present a groupwise graph-theory-based parcellation approach to define nodes for network analysis. The application of network-theory-based analysis to extend the utility of functional {MRI} has recently received increased attention. Such analyses require first and foremost a reasonable definition of a set of nodes as input to the network analysis. To date many applications have used existing atlases based on cytoarchitecture, task-based {fMRI} activations, or anatomic delineations. A potential pitfall in using such atlases is that the mean timecourse of a node may not represent any of the constituent timecourses if different functional areas are included within a single node. The proposed approach involves a groupwise optimization that ensures functional homogeneity within each subunit and that these definitions are consistent at the group level. Parcellation reproducibility of each subunit is computed across multiple groups of healthy volunteers and is demonstrated to be high. Issues related to the selection of appropriate number of nodes in the brain are considered. Within typical parameters of {fMRI} resolution, parcellation results are shown for a total of 100, 200, and 300 subunits. Such parcellations may ultimately serve as a functional atlas for {fMRI} and as such three atlases at the 100-, 200- and 300-parcellation levels derived from 79 healthy normal volunteers are made freely available online along with tools to interface this atlas with {SPM}, {BioImage} Suite and other analysis packages.

We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion {MRI} that were developed by the {HCP} to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the {HCP}. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced {CIFTI} file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the {HCP} minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the {HCP}'s acquisition protocols or using these pipelines.

Computational psychiatry combines multiple levels and types of computation with multiple types of data in an effort to improve understanding, prediction and treatment of mental illness. Computational psychiatry, broadly defined, encompasses two complementary approaches: data driven and theory driven. Data-driven approaches apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional data to improve classification of disease, predict treatment outcomes or improve treatment selection. These approaches are generally agnostic as to the underlying mechanisms. Theory-driven approaches, in contrast, use models that instantiate prior knowledge of, or explicit hypotheses about, such mechanisms, possibly at multiple levels of analysis and abstraction. We review recent advances in both approaches, with an emphasis on clinical applications, and highlight the utility of combining them.}

abstract = {Many sources of fluctuation contribute to the {fMRI} signal, and this makes identifying the effects that are truly related to the underlying neuronal activity difficult. Independent component analysis ({ICA}) - one of the most widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of {fMRI} data - has shown to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of neuronally-related and artefactual fluctuation in {fMRI} data (both with the application of external stimuli and with the subject "at rest"). {ICA} decomposes {fMRI} data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add linearly to explain voxel-wise time series. Given the set of {ICA} components, if the components representing "signal" (brain activity) can be distinguished form the "noise" components (effects of motion, non-neuronal physiology, scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources), the latter can then be removed from the data, providing an effective cleanup of structured noise. Manual classification of components is labour intensive and requires expertise; hence, a fully automatic noise detection algorithm that can reliably detect various types of noise sources (in both task and resting {fMRI}) is desirable. In this paper, we introduce {FIX} ("{FMRIB}'s {ICA}-based X-noiseifier"), which provides an automatic solution for denoising {fMRI} data via accurate classification of {ICA} components. For each {ICA} component {FIX} generates a large number of distinct spatial and temporal features, each describing a different aspect of the data (e.g., what proportion of temporal fluctuations are at high frequencies). The set of features is then fed into a multi-level classifier (built around several different classifiers). Once trained through the hand-classification of a sufficient number of training datasets, the classifier can then automatically classify new datasets. The noise components can then be subtracted from (or regressed out of) the original data, to provide automated cleanup. On conventional resting-state {fMRI} ({rfMRI}) single-run datasets, {FIX} achieved about 95\% overall accuracy. On high-quality {rfMRI} data from the Human Connectome Project, {FIX} achieves over 99\% classification accuracy, and as a result is being used in the default {rfMRI} processing pipeline for generating {HCP} connectomes. {FIX} is publicly available as a plugin for {FSL}.

This architecture embodies an inherently complex relationship between connection topology, the spatial arrangement of network elements, and the resulting network cost and functional performance. An exploration of these interacting factors and driving forces may reveal salient network features that are critically important for shaping and constraining the brain's topological organization and its evolvability. Several studies have pointed to an economic balance between network cost and network efficiency with networks organized in an 'economical' small-world favouring high communication efficiency at a low wiring cost. In this study, we define and explore a network morphospace in order to characterize different aspects of communication efficiency in human brain networks. Using a multi-objective evolutionary approach that approximates a Pareto-optimal set within the morphospace, we investigate the capacity of anatomical brain networks to evolve towards topologies that exhibit optimal information processing features while preserving network cost. This approach allows us to investigate network topologies that emerge under specific selection pressures, thus providing some insight into the selectional forces that may have shaped the network architecture of existing human brains.}

abstract = {Constrained spherical deconvolution ({CSD}) has become one of the most widely used methods to extract white matter ({WM}) fibre orientation information from diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DW}-{MRI}) data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high quality fibre orientation distribution function ({fODF}) estimates and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain apparent fibre density ({AFD}) measures. Unfortunately, {CSD} typically only supports data acquired on a single shell in q-space. With multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent, there is a growing need for {CSD} to fully support such data. Furthermore, {CSD} can only provide high quality {fODF} estimates in voxels containing {WM} only. In voxels containing other tissue types such as grey matter ({GM}) and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}), the {WM} response function may no longer be appropriate and spherical deconvolution produces unreliable, noisy {fODF} estimates. The aim of this study is to incorporate support for multi-shell data into the {CSD} approach as well as to exploit the unique b-value dependencies of the different tissue types to estimate a multi-tissue {ODF}. The resulting approach is dubbed multi-shell, multi-tissue {CSD} ({MSMT}-{CSD}) and is compared to the state-of-the-art single-shell, single-tissue {CSD} ({\SSST}-{CSD}) approach. Using both simulations and real data, we show that {MSMT}-{CSD} can produce reliable {WM}/{GM}/{CSF} volume fraction maps, directly from the {DW} data, whereas {\SSST}-{CSD} has a tendency to overestimate the {WM} volume in voxels containing {GM} and/or {CSF}. In addition, compared to {\SSST}-{CSD}, {MSMT}-{CSD} can substantially increase the precision of the {fODF} fibre orientations and reduce the presence of spurious {fODF} peaks in voxels containing {GM} and/or {CSF}. Both effects translate into more reliable {AFD} measures and tractography results with {MSMT}-{CSD} compared to {\SSST}-{CSD}. Copyright \copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

In particular, it was proposed that there exists two systems in the brain that are intrinsically organized into anticorrelated networks, the default mode network, which usually exhibits task-related deactivations, and the task-positive network, which usually exhibits task-related activations during tasks that demands external attention. However, it is currently under debate whether the anticorrelations observed in resting state {fMRI} were valid or were instead artificially introduced by global signal regression, a common preprocessing technique to remove physiological and other noise in resting-state {fMRI} signal. We examined positive and negative correlations in resting-state connectivity using two different preprocessing methods: a component base noise reduction method ({CompCor}, Behzadi et al., 2007), in which principal components from noise regions-of-interest were removed, and the global signal regression method. Robust anticorrelations between a default mode network seed region in the medial prefrontal cortex and regions of the task-positive network were observed under both methods. Specificity of the anticorrelations was similar between the two methods. Specificity and sensitivity for positive correlations were higher under {CompCor} compared to the global regression method. Our results suggest that anticorrelations observed in resting-state connectivity are not an artifact introduced by global signal regression and might have biological origins, and that the {CompCor} method can be used to examine valid anticorrelations during rest.

abstract = {A growing field of research explores links between behavioral measures and functional connectivity ({FC}) assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Recent studies suggest that measurement of these relationships may be corrupted by head motion artifact. Using data from the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}), we find that a surprising number of behavioral, demographic, and physiological measures (23 of 122), including fluid intelligence, reading ability, weight, and psychiatric diagnostic scales, correlate with head motion. We demonstrate that "trait" (across-subject) and "state" (across-day, within-subject) effects of motion on {FC} are remarkably similar in {HCP} data, suggesting that state effects of motion could potentially mimic trait correlates of behavior. Thus, head motion is a likely source of systematic errors (bias) in the measurement of {FC}:behavior relationships. Next, we show that data cleaning strategies reduce the influence of head motion and substantially alter previously reported {FC}:behavior relationship. Our results suggest that spurious relationships mediated by head motion may be widespread in studies linking {FC} to behavior. \copyright The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.}

abstract = {A better characterization of how an individual's brain is functionally organized will likely bring dramatic advances to many fields of study. Here we show a model-based approach toward characterizing resting state functional connectivity {MRI} (rs-{fcMRI}) that is capable of identifying a so-called "connectotype", or functional fingerprint in individual participants. The approach rests on a simple linear model that proposes the activity of a given brain region can be described by the weighted sum of its functional neighboring regions. The resulting coefficients correspond to a personalized model-based connectivity matrix that is capable of predicting the timeseries of each subject. Importantly, the model itself is subject specific and has the ability to predict an individual at a later date using a limited number of non-sequential frames. While we show that there is a significant amount of shared variance between models across subjects, the model's ability to discriminate an individual is driven by unique connections in higher order control regions in frontal and parietal cortices. Furthermore, we show that the connectotype is present in non-human primates as well, highlighting the translational potential of the approach.}

Previous work has described local functional gradients extending from perceptual and motor regions to cortical areas representing more abstract functions, but an overarching framework for the association between structure and function is still lacking. Here, we show that the principal gradient revealed by the decomposition of connectivity data in humans and the macaque monkey is anchored by, at one end, regions serving primary sensory/motor functions and at the other end, transmodal regions that, in humans, are known as the default-mode network ({DMN}). These {DMN} regions exhibit the greatest geodesic distance along the cortical surface-and are precisely equidistant-from primary sensory/motor morphological landmarks. The principal gradient also provides an organizing spatial framework for multiple large-scale networks and characterizes a spectrum from unimodal to heteromodal activity in a functional metaanalysis. Together, these observations provide a characterization of the topographical organization of cortex and indicate that the role of the {DMN} in cognition might arise from its position at one extreme of a hierarchy, allowing it to process transmodal information that is unrelated to immediate sensory input.}

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), is often treated as a trait, used, for example, to draw inferences about individual differences in cognitive function, or differences between healthy or diseased populations. However, functional connectivity can also depend on the individual's mental state. In the present study, we examined the relative contribution of state and trait components in shaping an individual's functional architecture. We used {fMRI} data from a large, population-based human sample (N = 587, age 18-88 years), as part of the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience (Cam-{CAN}), which were collected in three mental states: resting, performing a sensorimotor task, and watching a movie. Whereas previous studies have shown commonalities across mental states in the average functional connectivity across individuals, we focused on the effects of states on the pattern of individual differences in functional connectivity. We found that state effects were as important as trait effects in shaping individual functional connectivity patterns, each explaining an approximately equal amount of variance. This was true when we looked at aging, as one specific dimension of individual differences, as well as when we looked at generic aspects of individual variation. These results show that individual differences in functional connectivity consist of state-dependent aspects, as well as more stable, trait-like characteristics. Studying individual differences in functional connectivity across a wider range of mental states will therefore provide a more complete picture of the mechanisms underlying factors such as cognitive ability, aging, and disease. {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}: The brain's functional architecture is remarkably similar across different individuals and across different mental states, which is why many studies use functional connectivity as a trait measure. Despite these trait-like aspects, functional connectivity varies over time and with changes in cognitive state. We measured connectivity in three different states to quantify the size of the trait-like component of functional connectivity, compared with the state-dependent component. Our results show that studying individual differences within one state (such as resting) uncovers only part of the relevant individual differences in brain function, and that the study of functional connectivity under multiple mental states is essential to disentangle connectivity differences that are transient versus those that represent more stable, trait-like characteristics of an individual.

Like other neuropsychiatric disorders, depression is not a unitary disease, but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses varied, co-occurring symptoms and divergent responses to treatment. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) in a large multisite sample (n = 1,188), we show here that patients with depression can be subdivided into four neurophysiological subtypes ('biotypes') defined by distinct patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal networks. Clustering patients on this basis enabled the development of diagnostic classifiers (biomarkers) with high (82-93\%) sensitivity and specificity for depression subtypes in multisite validation (n = 711) and out-of-sample replication (n = 477) data sets. These biotypes cannot be differentiated solely on the basis of clinical features, but they are associated with differing clinical-symptom profiles. They also predict responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (n = 154). Our results define novel subtypes of depression that transcend current diagnostic boundaries and may be useful for identifying the individuals who are most likely to benefit from targeted neurostimulation therapies.}

Here we combine {fMRI}, electrophysiology, and the monitoring of eyelid behavior to demonstrate an approach for tracking continuous variations in arousal level from {fMRI} data. We first characterize the spatial distribution of {fMRI} signal fluctuations that track a measure of behavioral arousal; taking this pattern as a template, and using the local field potential as a simultaneous and independent measure of cortical activity, we observe that the time-varying expression level of this template in {fMRI} data provides a close approximation of electrophysiological arousal. We discuss the potential benefit of these findings for increasing the sensitivity of {fMRI} as a cognitive and clinical biomarker.}

A great effort has been dedicated in the last two decades to investigate functional connectivity ({FC}), i.e. the functional interplay between different regions of the brain, which was for a long time assumed to have stationary nature. Only recently was the dynamic behaviour of {FC} revealed, showing that on top of correlational patterns of spontaneous {fMRI} signal fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions exhibits meaningful variations within a typical resting-state {fMRI} experiment. As a consequence, a considerable amount of work has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic {FC} ({dFC}), and several different approaches were explored to identify relevant {FC} fluctuations. At the same time, several questions were raised about the nature of {dFC}, which would be of interest only if brought back to a neural origin. In support of this, correlations with electroencephalography ({EEG}) recordings, demographic and behavioural data were established, and various clinical applications were explored, where the potential of {dFC} could be preliminarily demonstrated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive description of the {dFC} approaches proposed so far, and point at the directions that we see as most promising for the future developments of the field. Advantages and pitfalls of {dFC} analyses are addressed, helping the readers to orient themselves through the complex web of available methodologies and tools. Copyright \copyright 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {The brain is an inherently dynamic system, and executive cognition requires dynamically reconfiguring, highly evolving networks of brain regions that interact in complex and transient communication patterns. However, a precise characterization of these reconfiguration processes during cognitive function in humans remains elusive. Here, we use a series of techniques developed in the field of "dynamic network neuroscience" to investigate the dynamics of functional brain networks in 344 healthy subjects during a working-memory challenge (the "n-back" task). In contrast to a control condition, in which dynamic changes in cortical networks were spread evenly across systems, the effortful working-memory condition was characterized by a reconfiguration of frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks. This reconfiguration, which characterizes "network flexibility," employs transient and heterogeneous connectivity between frontal systems, which we refer to as "integration." Frontal integration predicted neuropsychological measures requiring working memory and executive cognition, suggesting that dynamic network reconfiguration between frontal systems supports those functions. Our results characterize dynamic reconfiguration of large-scale distributed neural circuits during executive cognition in humans and have implications for understanding impaired cognitive function in disorders affecting connectivity, such as schizophrenia or dementia.}

Recently, machine learning algorithms have been successfully used for magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnostic classification of neuropsychiatric patient populations. {OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether multivariate neuroanatomical pattern classification facilitates identification of individuals in different at-risk mental states ({ARMS}) of psychosis and enables the prediction of disease transition at the individual level. {DESIGN}: Multivariate neuroanatomical pattern classification was performed on the structural magnetic resonance imaging data of individuals in early or late {ARMS} vs healthy controls ({HCs}). The predictive power of the method was then evaluated by categorizing the baseline imaging data of individuals with transition to psychosis vs those without transition vs {HCs} after 4 years of clinical follow-up. Classification generalizability was estimated by cross-validation and by categorizing an independent cohort of 45 new {HCs}. {SETTING}: Departments of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. {PARTICIPANTS}: The first classification analysis included 20 early and 25 late at-risk individuals and 25 matched {HCs}. The second analysis consisted of 15 individuals with transition, 18 without transition, and 17 matched {HCs}. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of classification. {RESULTS}: The 3-group, cross-validated classification accuracies of the first analysis were 86\% ({HCs} vs the rest), 91\% (early at-risk individuals vs the rest), and 86\% (late at-risk individuals vs the rest). The accuracies in the second analysis were 90\% ({HCs} vs the rest), 88\% (individuals with transition vs the rest), and 86\% (individuals without transition vs the rest). Independent {HCs} were correctly classified in 96\% (first analysis) and 93\% (second analysis) of cases. {CONCLUSIONS}: Different {ARMSs} and their clinical outcomes may be reliably identified on an individual basis by assessing patterns of whole-brain neuroanatomical abnormalities. These patterns may serve as valuable biomarkers for the clinician to guide early detection in the prodromal phase of psychosis.}

However, little is known about alterations of the topological organization of brain functional networks in heavy smokers. Thirty-one heavy smokers and 33 non-smokers underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. The whole-brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding the correlation matrices of 90 brain regions and their topological properties were analyzed using graph network analysis. Non-parametric permutation tests were performed to investigate group differences in network topological measures and multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationships between the network metrics and smoking-related variables. Both heavy smokers and non-smokers exhibited small-world architecture in their brain functional networks. Compared with non-smokers, however, heavy smokers showed altered topological measurements characterized by lower global efficiency, higher local efficiency and clustering coefficients and greater path length. Furthermore, heavy smokers demonstrated decreased nodal global efficiency mainly in brain regions within the default mode network, whereas increased nodal local efficiency predominated in the visual-related regions. In addition, heavy smokers exhibited an association between the altered network metrics and the duration of cigarette use or the severity of nicotine dependence. Our results suggest that heavy smokers may have less efficient network architecture in the brain, and chronic cigarette smoking is associated with disruptions in the topological organization of brain networks. Our findings may further the understanding of the effects of chronic cigarette smoking on the brain and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying nicotine dependence. \copyright 2014 Society for the Study of Addiction.}

Technical advances and large-scale data sets have allowed for the development of models capable of predicting individual differences in traits and behavior using brain connectivity measures derived from neuroimaging data. Here, we present connectome-based predictive modeling ({CPM}), a data-driven protocol for developing predictive models of brain-behavior relationships from connectivity data using cross-validation. This protocol includes the following steps: (i) feature selection, (ii) feature summarization, (iii) model building, and (iv) assessment of prediction significance. We also include suggestions for visualizing the most predictive features (i.e., brain connections). The final result should be a generalizable model that takes brain connectivity data as input and generates predictions of behavioral measures in novel subjects, accounting for a considerable amount of the variance in these measures. It has been demonstrated that the {CPM} protocol performs as well as or better than many of the existing approaches in brain-behavior prediction. As {CPM} focuses on linear modeling and a purely data-driven approach, neuroscientists with limited or no experience in machine learning or optimization will find it easy to implement these protocols. Depending on the volume of data to be processed, the protocol can take 10-100 min for model building, 1-48 h for permutation testing, and 10-20 min for visualization of results.}

abstract = {Fundamental problems in neuroscience today are understanding how patterns of ongoing spontaneous activity are modified by task performance and whether/how these intrinsic patterns influence task-evoked activation and behavior. We examined these questions by comparing instantaneous functional connectivity ({IFC}) and directed functional connectivity ({DFC}) changes in two networks that are strongly correlated and segregated at rest: the visual ({VIS}) network and the dorsal attention network ({DAN}). We measured how {IFC} and {DFC} during a visuospatial attention task, which requires dynamic selective rerouting of visual information across hemispheres, changed with respect to rest. During the attention task, the two networks remained relatively segregated, and their general pattern of within-network correlation was maintained. However, attention induced a decrease of correlation in the {VIS} network and an increase of the {DAN}→{VIS} {IFC} and {DFC}, especially in a top-down direction. In contrast, within the {DAN}, {IFC} was not modified by attention, whereas {DFC} was enhanced. Importantly, {IFC} modulations were behaviorally relevant. We conclude that a stable backbone of within-network functional connectivity topography remains in place when transitioning between resting wakefulness and attention selection. However, relative decrease of correlation of ongoing "idling" activity in visual cortex and synchronization between frontoparietal and visual cortex were behaviorally relevant, indicating that modulations of resting activity patterns are important for task performance. Higher order resting connectivity in the {DAN} was relatively unaffected during attention, potentially indicating a role for simultaneous ongoing activity as a "prior" for attention selection.}

abstract = {A promising recent development in the study of brain function is the dynamic analysis of resting-state functional {MRI} scans, which can enhance understanding of normal cognition and alterations that result from brain disorders. One widely used method of capturing the dynamics of functional connectivity is sliding window correlation ({SWC}). However, in the absence of a "gold standard" for comparison, evaluating the performance of the {SWC} in typical resting-state data is challenging. This study uses simulated networks ({SNs}) with known transitions to examine the effects of parameters such as window length, window offset, window type, noise, filtering, and sampling rate on the {SWC} performance. The {SWC} time course was calculated for all node pairs of each {SN} and then clustered using the k-means algorithm to determine how resulting brain states match known configurations and transitions in the {SNs}. The outcomes show that the detection of state transitions and durations in the {SWC} is most strongly influenced by the window length and offset, followed by noise and filtering parameters. The effect of the image sampling rate was relatively insignificant. Tapered windows provide less sensitivity to state transitions than rectangular windows, which could be the result of the sharp transitions in the {SNs}. Overall, the {SWC} gave poor estimates of correlation for each brain state. Clustering based on the {SWC} time course did not reliably reflect the underlying state transitions unless the window length was comparable to the state duration, highlighting the need for new adaptive window analysis techniques.

abstract = {The human brain is organized into large-scale functional networks that can flexibly reconfigure their connectivity patterns, supporting both rapid adaptive control and long-term learning processes. However, it has remained unclear how short-term network dynamics support the rapid transformation of instructions into fluent behaviour. Comparing {fMRI} data of a learning sample (N=70) with a control sample (N=67), we find that increasingly efficient task processing during short-term practice is associated with a reorganization of large-scale network interactions. Practice-related efficiency gains are facilitated by enhanced coupling between the cingulo-opercular network and the dorsal attention network. Simultaneously, short-term task automatization is accompanied by decreasing activation of the fronto-parietal network, indicating a release of high-level cognitive control, and a segregation of the default mode network from task-related networks. These findings suggest that short-term task automatization is enabled by the brain's ability to rapidly reconfigure its large-scale network organization involving complementary integration and segregation processes.}

abstract = {Spatial smoothness is helpful when averaging {fMRI} signals across multiple subjects, as it allows different subjects' corresponding brain areas to be pooled together even if they are slightly misaligned. However, smoothing is usually not applied when performing multivoxel pattern-based analyses ({MVPA}), as it runs the risk of blurring away the information that fine-grained spatial patterns contain. It would therefore be desirable, if possible, to carry out pattern-based analyses which take unsmoothed data as their input but which produce smooth images as output. We show here that the Gaussian Naive Bayes ({GNB}) classifier does precisely this, when it is used in "searchlight" pattern-based analyses. We explain why this occurs, and illustrate the effect in real {fMRI} data. Moreover, we show that analyses using {GNBs} produce results at the multi-subject level which are statistically robust, neurally plausible, and which replicate across two independent data sets. By contrast, {SVM} classifiers applied to the same data do not generate a replication, even if the {SVM}-derived searchlight maps have smoothing applied to them. An additional advantage of {GNB} classifiers for searchlight analyses is that they are orders of magnitude faster to compute than more complex alternatives such as {SVMs}. Collectively, these results suggest that Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers may be a highly non-naive choice for multi-subject pattern-based {fMRI} studies.}

abstract = {While neuroimaging studies typically collapse data from many subjects, brain functional organization varies between individuals, and characterizing this variability is crucial for relating brain activity to behavioral phenotypes. Rest has become the default state for probing individual differences, chiefly because it is easy to acquire and a supposed neutral backdrop. However, the assumption that rest is the optimal condition for individual differences research is largely untested. In fact, other brain states may afford a better ratio of within- to between-subject variability, facilitating biomarker discovery. Depending on the trait or behavior under study, certain tasks may bring out meaningful idiosyncrasies across subjects, essentially enhancing the individual signal in networks of interest beyond what can be measured at rest. Here, we review theoretical considerations and existing work on how brain state influences individual differences in functional connectivity, present some preliminary analyses of within- and between-subject variability across conditions using data from the Human Connectome Project, and outline questions for future study.

Standards have been proposed based on test-retest reliability, but open questions remain. These include how amount of data per subject influences whole-brain reliability, the influence of increasing runs versus sessions, the spatial distribution of reliability, the reliability of multivariate methods, and, crucially, how reliability maps onto prediction of behavior. We collected a dataset of 12 extensively sampled individuals (144 min data each across 2 identically configured scanners) to assess test-retest reliability of whole-brain connectivity within the generalizability theory framework. We used Human Connectome Project data to replicate these analyses and relate reliability to behavioral prediction. Overall, the historical 5-min scan produced poor reliability averaged across connections. Increasing the number of sessions was more beneficial than increasing runs. Reliability was lowest for subcortical connections and highest for within-network cortical connections. Multivariate reliability was greater than univariate. Finally, reliability could not be used to improve prediction; these findings are among the first to underscore this distinction for functional connectivity. A comprehensive understanding of test-retest reliability, including its limitations, supports the development of best practices in the field. \copyright The Author 2017.

abstract = {In recent research, many univariate and multivariate approaches have been proposed to improve automatic classification of various dementia syndromes using imaging data. Some of these methods do not provide the possibility to integrate possible confounding variables like age into the statistical evaluation. A similar problem sometimes exists in clinical studies, as it is not always possible to match different clinical groups to each other in all confounding variables, like for example, early-onset (age\textless 65 years) and late-onset (age≥65) patients with Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Here, we propose a simple method to control for possible effects of confounding variables such as age prior to statistical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) data using support vector machine classification ({SVM}) or voxel-based morphometry ({VBM}). We compare {SVM} results for the classification of 80 {AD} patients and 79 healthy control subjects based on {MRI} data with and without prior age correction. Additionally, we compare {VBM} results for the comparison of three different groups of {AD} patients differing in age with the same group of control subjects obtained without including age as covariate, with age as covariate or with prior age correction using the proposed method. {SVM} classification using the proposed method resulted in higher between-group classification accuracy compared to uncorrected data. Further, applying the proposed age correction substantially improved univariate detection of disease-related grey matter atrophy using {VBM} in {AD} patients differing in age from control subjects. The results suggest that the approach proposed in this work is generally suited to control for confounding variables such as age in {SVM} or {VBM} analyses. Accordingly, the approach might improve and extend the application of these methods in clinical neurosciences.}

We currently show that aa enjoys the interpretability of clustering – without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness of svd – without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to do large scale aa, we derive an efficient algorithm based on projected gradient as well as an initialization procedure we denote {FurthestSum} that is inspired by the {FurthestFirst} approach widely used for k-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985 [14]). We generalize the aa procedure to kernel-aa in order to extract the principal convex hull in potential infinite Hilbert spaces and derive a relaxation of aa when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations of the observed data. We further demonstrate that the aa model is relevant for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction for a large variety of machine learning problems taken from computer vision, neuroimaging, chemistry, text mining and collaborative filtering leading to highly interpretable representations of the dynamics in the data.

In this paper we review Bayesian networks and how they can be learned automatically from data by means of structure learning algorithms. Also, we examine how a user can take advantage of these networks for reasoning by exact or approximate inference algorithms that propagate the given evidence through the graphical structure. Despite their applicability in many fields, they have been little used in neuroscience, where they have focused on specific problems, like functional connectivity analysis from neuroimaging data. Here we survey key research in neuroscience where Bayesian networks have been used with different aims: discover associations between variables, perform probabilistic reasoning over the model, and classify new observations with and without supervision. The networks are learned from data of any kind-morphological, electrophysiological, -omics and neuroimaging-, thereby broadening the scope-molecular, cellular, structural, functional, cognitive and medical- of the brain aspects to be studied.}

One metastate is associated with sensory and motor regions, and the other involves areas related to higher order cognition.

However, functional atlases so far proposed do not account for a crucial aspect of cerebral organization, namely homotopy, i.e. that each region in one hemisphere has a homologue in the other hemisphere. {NEW} {METHOD}: We present {AICHA} (for Atlas of Intrinsic Connectivity of Homotopic Areas), a functional brain {ROIs} atlas based on resting-state {fMRI} data acquired in 281 individuals. {AICHA} {ROIs} cover the whole cerebrum, each having 1-homogeneity of its constituting voxels intrinsic activity, and 2-a unique homotopic contralateral counterpart with which it has maximal intrinsic connectivity. {AICHA} was built in 4 steps: (1) estimation of resting-state networks ({RSNs}) using individual resting-state {fMRI} independent components, (2) k-means clustering of voxel-wise group level profiles of connectivity, (3) homotopic regional grouping based on maximal inter-hemispheric functional correlation, and (4) {ROI} labeling. {RESULTS}: {AICHA} includes 192 homotopic region pairs (122 gyral, 50 sulcal, and 20 gray nuclei). As an application, we report inter-hemispheric (homotopic and heterotopic) and intra-hemispheric connectivity patterns at different sparsities. {COMPARISON} {WITH} {EXISTING} {METHOD}: {ROI} functional homogeneity was higher for {AICHA} than for anatomical {ROI} atlases, but slightly lower than for another functional {ROI} atlas not accounting for homotopy. {CONCLUSION}: {AICHA} is ideally suited for intrinsic/effective connectivity analyses, as well as for investigating brain hemispheric specialization.

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity is a powerful tool for studying human functional brain networks. Temporal fluctuations in functional connectivity, i.e., dynamic functional connectivity ({dFC}), are thought to reflect dynamic changes in brain organization and non-stationary switching of discrete brain states. However, recent studies have suggested that {dFC} might be attributed to sampling variability of static {FC}. Despite this controversy, a detailed exposition of stationarity and statistical testing of {dFC} is lacking in the literature. This article seeks an in-depth exploration of these statistical issues at a level appealing to both neuroscientists and statisticians. We first review the statistical notion of stationarity, emphasizing its reliance on ensemble statistics. In contrast, all {FC} measures depend on sample statistics. An important consequence is that the space of stationary signals is much broader than expected, e.g., encompassing hidden markov models ({HMM}) widely used to extract discrete brain states. In other words, stationarity does not imply the absence of brain states. We then expound the assumptions underlying the statistical testing of {dFC}. It turns out that the two popular frameworks - phase randomization ({PR}) and autoregressive randomization ({ARR}) - generate stationary, linear, Gaussian null data. Therefore, statistical rejection can be due to non-stationarity, nonlinearity and/or non-Gaussianity. For example, the null hypothesis can be rejected for the stationary {HMM} due to nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity. Finally, we show that a common form of {ARR} (bivariate {ARR}) is susceptible to false positives compared with {PR} and an adapted version of {ARR} (multivariate {ARR}). Application of {PR} and multivariate {ARR} to Human Connectome Project data suggests that the stationary, linear, Gaussian null hypothesis cannot be rejected for most participants. However, failure to reject the null hypothesis does not imply that static {FC} can fully explain {dFC}. We find that first order {AR} models explain temporal {FC} fluctuations significantly better than static {FC} models. Since first order {AR} models encode both static {FC} and one-lag {FC}, this suggests the presence of dynamical information beyond static {FC}. Furthermore, even in subjects where the null hypothesis was rejected, {AR} models explain temporal {FC} fluctuations significantly better than a popular {HMM}, suggesting the lack of discrete states (as measured by resting-state {fMRI}). Overall, our results suggest that {AR} models are not only useful as a means for generating null data, but may be a powerful tool for exploring the dynamical properties of resting-state {fMRI}. Finally, we discuss how apparent contradictions in the growing {dFC} literature might be reconciled. Copyright \copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) are sensitive to artefacts caused by in-scanner head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of numerous denoising methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts. Here, we compare popular retrospective rs-{fMRI} denoising methods, such as regression of head motion parameters and mean white matter ({WM}) and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) (with and without expansion terms), {aCompCor}, volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global signal regression and {ICA}-{AROMA}, combined into 19 different pipelines. These pipelines were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in four independent datasets associated with varying levels of motion. Pipelines were benchmarked by examining the residual relationship between in-scanner movement and functional connectivity after denoising; the effect of distance on this residual relationship; whole-brain differences in functional connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls ({HC}); the temporal degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity of each pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in independent samples of people with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our results indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional {fMRI} time series against head motion parameters and {WM}/{CSF} signals (with or without expansion terms) is not sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2) {aCompCor} pipelines may only be viable in low-motion data; (3) volume censoring performs well at minimising motion-related artefact but a major benefit of this approach derives from the exclusion of high-motion individuals; (4) while not as effective as volume censoring, {ICA}-{AROMA} performed well across our benchmarks for relatively low cost in terms of data loss; (5) the addition of global signal regression improved the performance of nearly all pipelines on most benchmarks, but exacerbated the distance-dependence of correlations between motion and functional connectivity; and (6) group comparisons in functional connectivity between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are highly dependent on preprocessing strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and outline simple analyses to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to which a given set of findings may be affected by motion-related artefact.

Throughout recent years, statistical learning methods enjoy increasing popularity especially for applications in rich and complex data, including cross-validated out-of-sample prediction using pattern classification and sparsity-inducing regression. This concept paper discusses the implications of inferential justifications and algorithmic methodologies in common data analysis scenarios in neuroimaging. It is retraced how classical statistics and statistical learning originated from different historical contexts, build on different theoretical foundations, make different assumptions, and evaluate different outcome metrics to permit differently nuanced conclusions.

abstract = {A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological "atoms". Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic {fMRI}. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-{fMRI} signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field ({gwMRF}) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-{fMRI} and rs-{fMRI} across diverse acquisition protocols, we found {gwMRF} parcellations to be more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations. Furthermore, {gwMRF} parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic {fMRI}. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that {gwMRF} parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise {fMRI} data. Multiresolution parcellations generated from 1489 participants are publicly available (https://github.com/{ThomasYeoLab}/{CBIG}/tree/master/stable\_projects/brain\_parcellation/{Schaefer2018\_LocalGlobal}).}

We assessed nine meta-analytically derived functional networks, representing social, affective, executive, and mnemonic systems. {RSFC} of all networks was computed in a sample of 210 males and 210 well-matched females and in a replication sample of 155 males and 155 females.

Cross-validation prediction accuracy was defined as the correlation between true and predicted scores. {RSFC} within networks representing social, affective, mnemonic, and executive systems significantly predicted self-reported levels of Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Openness. {RSFC} patterns of most networks, however, predicted personality traits only either in males or in females. Personality traits can be predicted by patterns of {RSFC} in specific functional brain networks, providing new insights into the neurobiology of personality. However, as most associations were gender-specific, {RSFC}-personality relations should not be considered independently of gender.}

abstract = {The ability to make individual-level predictions from neuroanatomy has the potential to be particularly useful in child development. Previously, resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC}) {MRI} has been used to successfully predict maturity and diagnosis of typically and atypically developing individuals. Unfortunately, submillimeter head motion in the scanner produces systematic, distance-dependent differences in {RSFC} and may contaminate, and potentially facilitate, these predictions. Here, we evaluated individual age prediction with {RSFC} after stringent motion denoising. Using multivariate machine learning, we found that 57\% of the variance in individual {RSFC} after motion artifact denoising was explained by age, while 4\% was explained by residual effects of head motion. When {RSFC} data were not adequately denoised, 50\% of the variance was explained by motion. Reducing motion-related artifact also revealed that prediction did not depend upon characteristics of functional connections previously hypothesized to mediate development (e.g., connection distance). Instead, successful age prediction relied upon sampling functional connections across multiple functional systems with strong, reliable {RSFC} within an individual. Our results demonstrate that {RSFC} across the brain is sufficiently robust to make individual-level predictions of maturity in typical development, and hence, may have clinical utility for the diagnosis and prognosis of individuals with atypical developmental trajectories. \copyright The Author(s) 2018.

In two large, independent data sets, we here show that cognitive tasks amplify trait-relevant individual differences in patterns of functional connectivity, such that predictive models built from task {fMRI} data outperform models built from resting-state {fMRI} data. Further, certain tasks consistently yield better predictions of fluid intelligence than others, and the task that generates the best-performing models varies by sex. By considering task-induced brain state and sex, the best-performing model explains over 20\% of the variance in fluid intelligence scores, as compared to \textless 6\% of variance explained by rest-based models.

However, the relationship between pathological brain activity and clinical symptoms are not well defined. Therefore, we used regional {BOLD} signal variability/amplitude of low-frequency oscillations ({LFOs}) to identify functional brain abnormalities in the dynamic pain connectome in chronic pain patients that are related to chronic pain characteristics (i.e., pain intensity). Moreover, we examined whether there were sex-specific attributes of these functional brain abnormalities and whether functional brain abnormalities in patients is related to pain intensity characteristics on different time scales. We acquired resting-state functional {MRI} and quantified frequency-specific regional {LFOs} in chronic pain patients with ankylosing spondylitis. We found that patients exhibit frequency-specific aberrations in {LFOs}. Specifically, lower-frequency (slow-5) abnormalities were restricted to the ascending pain pathway (thalamus and S1), whereas higher-frequency abnormalities also included the default mode (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex; slow-3, slow-4) and salience (i.e., mid-cingulate cortex) networks (slow-4). Using a machine learning approach, we found that these abnormalities, in particular within higher frequencies (slow-3), can be used to make generalizable inferences about patients' average pain ratings (trait-like pain) but not current (i.e., state-like) pain levels. Furthermore, we identified sex differences in {LFOs} in patients that were not present in healthy controls. These novel findings reveal mechanistic brain abnormalities underlying the longer-lasting symptoms (trait pain intensity) in chronic pain.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Measures of moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain activity of an individual at rest have been shown to be a reliable metric for studying functional brain associated with chronic pain. The current results demonstrate that dysfunction in these intrinsic fluctuations/oscillations in the ascending pain pathway, default mode network, and salience network during resting state display sex differences and can be used to make inferences about trait-like pain intensity ratings in chronic pain patients. These results provide robust and generalizable implications for investigating brain mechanisms associated with longer-lasting/trait-like chronic pain symptoms.

A major question is whether individual-specific network topography (i.e., location and spatial arrangement) is behaviorally relevant. Here, we propose a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model ({MS}-{HBM}) for estimating individual-specific cortical networks and investigate whether individual-specific network topography can predict human behavior. The multiple layers of the {MS}-{HBM} explicitly differentiate intra-subject (within-subject) from inter-subject (between-subject) network variability. By ignoring intra-subject variability, previous network mappings might confuse intra-subject variability for inter-subject differences. Compared with other approaches, {MS}-{HBM} parcellations generalized better to new rs-{fMRI} and task-{fMRI} data from the same subjects. More specifically, {MS}-{HBM} parcellations estimated from a single rs-{fMRI} session (10 min) showed comparable generalizability as parcellations estimated by 2 state-of-the-art methods using 5 sessions (50 min). We also showed that behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality, and emotion could be predicted by individual-specific network topography with modest accuracy, comparable to previous reports predicting phenotypes based on connectivity strength. Network topography estimated by {MS}-{HBM} was more effective for behavioral prediction than network size, as well as network topography estimated by other parcellation approaches. Thus, similar to connectivity strength, individual-specific network topography might also serve as a fingerprint of human behavior. \copyright The Author(s) 2018.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: As greater numbers of us are living longer, it is increasingly important to understand how we can age healthily. Although old age is often stereotyped as a time of declining mental abilities and inflexibility, cognitive neuroscience reveals that older adults use neural and cognitive resources flexibly, recruiting novel neural regions and cognitive processes when necessary. Our aim in this project is to understand how age-related changes to neural structure and function interact to support cognitive abilities across the lifespan. {METHODS}/{DESIGN}: We are recruiting a population-based cohort of 3000 adults aged 18 and over into Stage 1 of the project, where they complete an interview including health and lifestyle questions, a core cognitive assessment, and a self-completed questionnaire of lifetime experiences and physical activity. Of those interviewed, 700 participants aged 18-87 (100 per age decile) continue to Stage 2 where they undergo cognitive testing and provide measures of brain structure and function. Cognition is assessed across multiple domains including attention and executive control, language, memory, emotion, action control and learning. A subset of 280 adults return for in-depth neurocognitive assessment in Stage 3, using functional neuroimaging experiments across our key cognitive domains.Formal statistical models will be used to examine the changes that occur with healthy ageing, and to evaluate age-related reorganisation in terms of cognitive and neural functions invoked to compensate for overall age-related brain structural decline. Taken together the three stages provide deep phenotyping that will allow us to measure neural activity and flexibility during performance across a number of core cognitive functions. This approach offers hypothesis-driven insights into the relationship between brain and behaviour in healthy ageing that are relevant to the general population. {DISCU\SSION}: Our study is a unique resource of neuroimaging and cognitive measures relevant to change across the adult lifespan. Because we focus on normal age-related changes, our results may contribute to changing views about the ageing process, lead to targeted interventions, and reveal how normal ageing relates to frail ageing in clinicopathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.}

Findings to date have been severely limited by a number of factors, including small sample size and omission of out-of-sample prediction. We capitalized on the recent availability of a large database, together with the emergence of specific criteria for best practices in neuroimaging studies of individual differences. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 884 young healthy adults in the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}) database. We attempted to predict personality traits from the "Big Five", as assessed with the {NEO}-{FFI} test, using individual functional connectivity matrices. After regressing out potential confounds (such as age, sex, handedness and fluid intelligence), we used a cross-validated framework, together with test-retest replication (across two sessions of resting-state {fMRI} for each subject), to quantify how well the neuroimaging data could predict each of the five personality factors. We tested three different (published) denoising strategies for the {fMRI} data, two inter-subject alignment and brain parcellation schemes, and three different linear models for prediction. As measurement noise is known to moderate statistical relationships, we performed final prediction analyses using average connectivity across both imaging sessions (1 h of data), with the analysis pipeline that yielded the highest predictability overall. Across all results (test/retest; 3 denoising strategies; 2 alignment schemes; 3 models), Openness to experience emerged as the only reliably predicted personality factor. Using the full hour of resting-state data and the best pipeline, we could predict Openness to experience ({NEOFAC\_O}: r=0.24, R2=0.024) almost as well as we could predict the score on a 24-item intelligence test ({PMAT24\_A\_CR}: r=0.26, R2=0.044). Other factors (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness) yielded weaker predictions across results that were not statistically significant under permutation testing. We also derived two superordinate personality factors ("\alpha" and "\beta") from a principal components analysis of the {NEO}-{FFI} factor scores, thereby reducing noise and enhancing the precision of these measures of personality. We could account for 5\% of the variance in the \beta superordinate factor (r=0.27, R2=0.050), which loads highly on Openness to experience. We conclude with a discussion of the potential for predicting personality from neuroimaging data and make specific recommendations for the field.}

abstract = {To determine why many diagnostic tests have proved to be valueless after optimistic introduction into medical practice, we reviewed a series of investigations and identified two major problems that can cause erroneous statistical results for the "sensitivity" and "specificity" indexes of diagnostic efficacy. Unless an appropriately broad spectrum is chosen for the diseased and nondiseased patients who comprise the study population, the diagnostic test may receive falsely high values for its "rule-in" and "rule-out" performances. Unless the interpretation of the test and the establishment of the true diagnosis are done independently, bias may falsely elevate the test's efficacy. Avoidance of these problems might have prevented the early optimism and subsequent disillusionment with the diagnostic value of two selected examples: the carcinoembryonic antigen and nitro-blue tetrazolium tests.}

abstract = {Graph theoretical analysis has played a key role in characterizing global features of the topology of complex networks, describing diverse systems such as protein interactions, food webs, social relations and brain connectivity. How system elements communicate with each other depends not only on the structure of the network, but also on the nature of the system's dynamics which are constrained by the amount of knowledge and resources available for communication processes. Complementing widely used measures that capture efficiency under the assumption that communication preferentially follows shortest paths across the network ("routing"), we define analytic measures directed at characterizing network communication when signals flow in a random walk process ("diffusion"). The two dimensions of routing and diffusion efficiency define a morphospace for complex networks, with different network topologies characterized by different combinations of efficiency measures and thus occupying different regions of this space. We explore the relation of network topologies and efficiency measures by examining canonical network models, by evolving networks using a multi-objective optimization strategy, and by investigating real-world network data sets. Within the efficiency morphospace, specific aspects of network topology that differentially favor efficient communication for routing and diffusion processes are identified. Charting regions of the morphospace that are occupied by canonical, evolved or real networks allows inferences about the limits of communication efficiency imposed by connectivity and dynamics, as well as the underlying selection pressures that have shaped network topology.}

abstract = {The nature of mental illness remains a conundrum. Traditional disease categories are increasingly suspected to misrepresent the causes underlying mental disturbance. Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than {DSM}/{ICD} diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into psychiatric practice.

More recent efforts are extending this approach to include infants, children, older adults, and brain disorders. This paper introduces and describes the Human Connectome Project in Aging ({HCP}-A), which is currently recruiting 1200 + healthy adults aged 36 to 100+, with a subset of 600 + participants returning for longitudinal assessment. Four acquisition sites using matched Siemens Prisma {3T} {MRI} scanners with centralized quality control and data analysis are enrolling participants. Data are acquired across multimodal imaging and behavioral domains with a focus on factors known to be altered in advanced aging. {MRI} acquisitions include structural (whole brain and high resolution hippocampal) plus multiband resting state functional ({rfMRI}), task {fMRI} ({tfMRI}), diffusion {MRI} ({dMRI}), and arterial spin labeling ({ASL}). Behavioral characterization includes cognitive (such as processing speed and episodic memory), psychiatric, metabolic, and socioeconomic measures as well as assessment of systemic health (with a focus on menopause via hormonal assays). This dataset will provide a unique resource for examining how brain organization and connectivity changes across typical aging, and how these differences relate to key characteristics of aging including alterations in hormonal status and declining memory and general cognition. A primary goal of the {HCP}-A is to make these data freely available to the scientific community, supported by the Connectome Coordination Facility ({CCF}) platform for data quality assurance, preprocessing and basic analysis, and shared via the {NIMH} Data Archive ({NDA}). Here we provide the rationale for our study design and sufficient details of the resource for scientists to plan future analyses of these data.

abstract = {The amplitudes of spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity may be a significant source of within-subject and between-subject variability, and this variability is likely to be carried through into functional connectivity ({FC}) estimates (whether directly or indirectly). Therefore, improving our understanding of amplitude fluctuations over the course of a resting state scan and variation in amplitude across individuals is of great relevance to the interpretation of {FC} findings. We investigate resting state amplitudes in two large-scale studies ({HCP} and {UK} Biobank), with the aim of determining between-subject and within-subject variability. Between-subject clustering distinguished between two groups of brain networks whose amplitude variation across subjects were highly correlated with each other, revealing a clear distinction between primary sensory and motor regions ('primary sensory/motor cluster') and cognitive networks. Within subjects, all networks in the primary sensory/motor cluster showed a consistent increase in amplitudes from the start to the end of the scan. In addition to the strong increases in primary sensory/motor amplitude, a large number of changes in {FC} were found when comparing the two scans acquired on the same day ({HCP} data). Additive signal change analysis confirmed that all of the observed {FC} changes could be fully explained by changes in amplitude. Between-subject correlations in {UK} Biobank data showed a negative correlation between primary sensory/motor amplitude and average sleep duration, suggesting a role of arousal. Our findings additionally reveal complex relationships between amplitude and head motion. These results suggest that network amplitude is a source of significant variability both across subjects, and within subjects on a within-session timescale. Future {rfMRI} studies may benefit from obtaining arousal-related (self report) measures, and may wish to consider the influence of amplitude changes on measures of (dynamic) functional connectivity.

One such methodological approach is the examination of resting-state functional connectivity, which quantifies correlations in low-frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging signal between disparate brain regions in the absence of task performance. Here, evidence of differentiated effects of chronic nicotine exposure, which reduces the efficiency of network communication across the brain, and acute nicotine exposure, which increases connectivity within specific limbic circuits, is discussed. Several large-scale resting networks, including the salience, default, and executive control networks, have also been implicated in nicotine addiction. The dynamics of connectivity changes among and between these large-scale networks during nicotine withdrawal and satiety provide a heuristic framework with which to characterize the neurobiological mechanism of addiction. The ability to simultaneously quantify effects of both chronic (trait) and acute (state) nicotine exposure provides a platform to develop a neuroimaging-based addiction biomarker. While such development remains in its early stages, evidence of coherent modulations in resting-state functional connectivity at various stages of nicotine addiction suggests potential network interactions on which to focus future addiction biomarker development.

Despite a rapidly growing body of literature, however, functional connectivity research has yet to deliver biomarkers that can aid psychiatric diagnosis or prognosis at the single-subject level. One impediment to developing such practical tools has been uncertainty regarding the ratio of intra- to interindividual variability in functional connectivity; in other words, how much variance is state- versus trait-related. Here, we review recent evidence that functional connectivity profiles are both reliable within subjects and unique across subjects, and that features of these profiles relate to behavioral phenotypes. Together, these results suggest the potential to discover reliable correlates of present and future illness and/or response to treatment in the strength of an individual's functional brain connections. Ultimately, this work could help develop personalized approaches to psychiatric illness.}

Prior research has identified static neural connectivity correlates of this trait. Here, we use dynamic functional connectivity ({DFC}) analysis of resting-state {fMRI} to study time-varying connectivity patterns associated with naturally varying and objectively measured trait mindfulness. Participants were selected from the top and bottom tertiles of performers on a breath-counting task to form high trait mindfulness ({HTM}; N = 21) and low trait mindfulness ({LTM}; N = 18) groups. {DFC} analysis of resting state {fMRI} data revealed that the {HTM} group spent significantly more time in a brain state associated with task-readiness - a state characterized by high within-network connectivity and greater anti-correlations between task-positive networks and the default-mode network ({DMN}). The {HTM} group transitioned between brain states more frequently, but the dwell time in each episode of the task-ready state was equivalent between groups. These results persisted even after controlling for vigilance. Across individuals, certain connectivity metrics were weakly correlated with self-reported mindfulness as measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, though these did not survive multiple comparisons correction. In the static connectivity maps, {HTM} individuals had greater within-network connectivity in the {DMN} and the salience network, and greater anti-correlations between the {DMN} and task-positive networks. In sum, {DFC} features robustly distinguish {HTM} and {LTM} individuals, and may be useful biological markers for the measurement of dispositional mindfulness. Copyright \copyright 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that the individual fingerprint of a human functional connectome can be maximized from a reconstruction procedure based on group-wise decomposition in a finite number of brain connectivity modes. We use data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that the optimal reconstruction of the individual {FCs} through connectivity eigenmodes maximizes subject identifiability across resting-state and all seven tasks evaluated. The identifiability of the optimally reconstructed individual connectivity profiles increases both at the global and edgewise level, also when the reconstruction is imposed on additional functional data of the subjects. Furthermore, reconstructed {FC} data provide more robust associations with task-behavioral measurements. Finally, we extend this approach to also map the most task-sensitive functional connections. Results show that is possible to maximize individual fingerprinting in the functional connectivity domain regardless of the task, a crucial next step in the area of brain connectivity towards individualized connectomics.}

The role of transition between brain networks is poorly understood, and whether switching between these states is important for behavior has been little studied. Our aim was to model switching between functional brain networks using multilayer network methods and test for associations between model parameters and behavioral measures. We calculated time-resolved {fMRI} connectivity in 1,003 healthy human adults from the Human Connectome Project. The time-resolved {fMRI} connectivity data were used to generate a spatiotemporal multilayer modularity model enabling us to quantify network switching, which we define as the rate at which each brain region transits between different networks. We found (i) an inverse relationship between network switching and connectivity dynamics, where the latter was defined in terms of time-resolved {fMRI} connections with variance in time that significantly exceeded phase-randomized surrogate data; (ii) brain connectivity was lower during intervals of network switching; (iii) brain areas with frequent network switching had greater temporal complexity; (iv) brain areas with high network switching were located in association cortices; and (v) using cross-validated elastic net regression, network switching predicted intersubject variation in working memory performance, planning/reasoning, and amount of sleep. Our findings shed light on the importance of brain dynamics predicting task performance and amount of sleep. The ability to switch between network configurations thus appears to be a fundamental feature of optimal brain function. Copyright \copyright 2018 the Author(s). Published by {PNAS}.}

Meta-analyses of {fMRI} studies of executive functions ({EFs}) show that {ADHD} patients have cognitive-domain dissociated complex multisystem impairments in several right and left hemispheric dorsal, ventral and medial fronto-cingulo-striato-thalamic and fronto-parieto-cerebellar networks that mediate cognitive control, attention, timing and working memory ({WM}). There is furthermore emerging evidence for abnormalities in orbital and ventromedial prefrontal and limbic areas that mediate motivation and emotion control. In addition, poor deactivation of the default mode network ({DMN}) suggests an abnormal interrelationship between hypo-engaged task-positive and poorly "switched off" hyper-engaged task-negative networks, both of which are related to impaired cognition. Translational cognitive neuroscience in {ADHD} is still in its infancy. Pattern recognition analyses have attempted to provide diagnostic classification of {ADHD} using {fMRI} data with respectable classification accuracies of over 80\%. Necessary replication studies, however, are still outstanding. Brain stimulation has been tested in heterogeneously designed, small numbered proof of concept studies targeting key frontal functional impairments in {ADHD}. Transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS}) appears to be promising to improve {ADHD} symptoms and cognitive functions based on some studies, but larger clinical trials of repeated stimulation with and without cognitive training are needed to test clinical efficacy and potential costs on non-targeted functions. Only three studies have piloted {NF} of {fMRI}-based frontal dysfunctions in {ADHD} using {fMRI} or near-infrared spectroscopy, with the two larger ones finding some improvements in cognition and symptoms, which, however, were not superior to the active control conditions, suggesting potential placebo effects. Neurotherapeutics seems attractive for {ADHD} due to their safety and potential longer-term neuroplastic effects, which drugs cannot offer. However, they need to be thoroughly tested for short- and longer-term clinical and cognitive efficacy and their potential for individualized treatment.}

abstract = {Most neuroscientific studies have focused on task-evoked activations (activity amplitudes at specific brain locations), providing limited insight into the functional relationships between separate brain locations. Task-state functional connectivity ({FC}) - statistical association between brain activity time series during task performance - moves beyond task-evoked activations by quantifying functional interactions during tasks. However, many task-state {FC} studies do not remove the first-order effect of task-evoked activations prior to estimating task-state {FC}. It has been argued that this results in the ambiguous inference "likely active or interacting during the task", rather than the intended inference "likely interacting during the task". Utilizing a neural mass computational model, we verified that task-evoked activations substantially and inappropriately inflate task-state {FC} estimates, especially in functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) data. Various methods attempting to address this problem have been developed, yet the efficacies of these approaches have not been systematically assessed. We found that most standard approaches for fitting and removing mean task-evoked activations were unable to correct these inflated correlations. In contrast, methods that flexibly fit mean task-evoked response shapes effectively corrected the inflated correlations without reducing effects of interest. Results with empirical {fMRI} data confirmed the model's predictions, revealing activation-induced task-state {FC} inflation for both Pearson correlation and psychophysiological interaction ({PPI}) approaches. These results demonstrate that removal of mean task-evoked activations using an approach that flexibly models task-evoked response shape is an important preprocessing step for valid estimation of task-state {FC}.

abstract = {Intrinsic connectivity, measured using resting-state {fMRI}, has emerged as a fundamental tool in the study of the human brain. However, due to practical limitations, many studies do not collect enough resting-state data to generate reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity necessary for studying individual differences. Here we present general functional connectivity ({GFC}) as a method for leveraging shared features across resting-state and task {fMRI} and demonstrate in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Study that {GFC} offers better test-retest reliability than intrinsic connectivity estimated from the same amount of resting-state data alone. Furthermore, at equivalent scan lengths, {GFC} displayed higher estimates of heritability than resting-state functional connectivity. We also found that predictions of cognitive ability from {GFC} generalized across datasets, performing as well or better than resting-state or task data alone. Collectively, our work suggests that {GFC} can improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in existing datasets and, subsequently, the opportunity to identify meaningful correlates of individual differences in behavior. Given that task and resting-state data are often collected together, many researchers can immediately derive more reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity through the adoption of {GFC} rather than solely using resting-state data. Moreover, by better capturing heritable variation in intrinsic connectivity, {GFC} represents a novel endophenotype with broad applications in clinical neuroscience and biomarker discovery.

abstract = {The utility and success of resting-state functional connectivity {MRI} (rs-{fcMRI}) depend critically on the reliability of this technique and the extent to which it accurately reflects neuronal function. One challenge is that rs-{fcMRI} is influenced by various sources of noise, particularly cardiac- and respiratory-related signal variations. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the impact of various physiological noise correction techniques, specifically those that use independent cardiac and respiration measures, on the test-retest reliability of rs-{fcMRI}. A group of 25 subjects were each scanned at three time points--two within the same imaging session and another 2-3 months later. Physiological noise corrections accounted for significant variance, particularly in blood vessels, sagittal sinus, cerebrospinal fluid, and gray matter. The fraction of variance explained by each of these corrections was highly similar within subjects between sessions, but variable between subjects. Physiological corrections generally reduced intrasubject (between-session) variability, but also significantly reduced intersubject variability, and thus reduced the test-retest reliability of estimating individual differences in functional connectivity. However, based on known nonneuronal mechanisms by which cardiac pulsation and respiration can lead to {MRI} signal changes, and the observation that the physiological noise itself is highly stable within individuals, removal of this noise will likely increase the validity of measured connectivity differences. Furthermore, removal of these fluctuations will lead to better estimates of average or group maps of connectivity. It is therefore recommended that studies apply physiological noise corrections but also be mindful of potential correlations with measures of interest.}

abstract = {There is significant interest in using resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC}) to predict human behavior. Good behavioral prediction should in theory require {RSFC} to be sufficiently distinct across participants; if {RSFC} were the same across participants, then behavioral prediction would obviously be poor. Therefore, we hypothesize that removing common resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) signals that are shared across participants would improve behavioral prediction. Here, we considered 803 participants from the human connectome project ({HCP}) with four rs-{fMRI} runs. We applied the common and orthogonal basis extraction ({COBE}) technique to decompose each {HCP} run into two subspaces: a common (group-level) subspace shared across all participants and a subject-specific subspace. We found that the first common {COBE} component of the first {HCP} run was localized to the visual cortex and was unique to the run. On the other hand, the second common {COBE} component of the first {HCP} run and the first common {COBE} component of the remaining {HCP} runs were highly similar and localized to regions within the default network, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Overall, this suggests the presence of run-specific (state-specific) effects that were shared across participants. By removing the first and second common {COBE} components from the first {HCP} run, and the first common {COBE} component from the remaining {HCP} runs, the resulting {RSFC} improves behavioral prediction by an average of 11.7\% across 58 behavioral measures spanning cognition, emotion and personality.

Although objective biomarkers for pain could substantially aid pain diagnosis and development of novel therapies, reliable markers for clinical pain have been elusive. In this study, individualized physical maneuvers were used to exacerbate clinical pain in patients with chronic low back pain (N = 53), thereby experimentally producing lower and higher pain states. Multivariate machine-learning models were then built from brain imaging (resting-state blood-oxygenation-level-dependent and arterial spin labeling functional imaging) and autonomic activity (heart rate variability) features to predict within-patient clinical pain intensity states (ie, lower vs higher pain) and were then applied to predict between-patient clinical pain ratings with independent training and testing data sets. Within-patient classification between lower and higher clinical pain intensity states showed best performance (accuracy = 92.45\%, area under the curve = 0.97) when all 3 multimodal parameters were combined. Between-patient prediction of clinical pain intensity using independent training and testing data sets also demonstrated significant prediction across pain ratings using the combined model (Pearson's r = 0.63). Classification of increased pain was weighted by elevated cerebral blood flow in the thalamus, and prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, and increased primary somatosensory connectivity to frontoinsular cortex. Our machine-learning approach introduces a model with putative biomarkers for clinical pain and multiple clinical applications alongside self-report, from pain assessment in noncommunicative patients to identification of objective pain endophenotypes that can be used in future longitudinal research aimed at discovery of new approaches to combat chronic pain.}

However, there is great variability in the analytic pipelines typically used to derive them from rest-{fMRI} cohorts. Here, we consider a specific type of studies, using predictive models on the edge weights of functional connectomes, for which we highlight the best modeling choices. We systematically study the prediction performances of models in 6 different cohorts and a total of 2000 individuals, encompassing neuro-degenerative (Alzheimer's, Post-traumatic stress disorder), neuro-psychiatric (Schizophrenia, Autism), drug impact (Cannabis use) clinical settings and psychological trait (fluid intelligence). The typical prediction procedure from rest-{fMRI} consists of three main steps: defining brain regions, representing the interactions, and supervised learning. For each step we benchmark typical choices: 8 different ways of defining regions -either pre-defined or generated from the rest-{fMRI} data- 3 measures to build functional connectomes from the extracted time-series, and 10 classification models to compare functional interactions across subjects. Our benchmarks summarize more than 240 different pipelines and outline modeling choices that show consistent prediction performances in spite of variations in the populations and sites. We find that regions defined from functional data work best; that it is beneficial to capture between-region interactions with tangent-based parametrization of covariances, a midway between correlations and partial correlation; and that simple linear predictors such as a logistic regression give the best predictions.

abstract = {Global signal regression ({GSR}) is one of the most debated preprocessing strategies for resting-state functional {MRI}. {GSR} effectively removes global artifacts driven by motion and respiration, but also discards globally distributed neural information and introduces negative correlations between certain brain regions. The vast majority of previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of {GSR} in removing imaging artifacts, as well as its potential biases. Given the growing interest in functional connectivity fingerprinting, here we considered the utilitarian question of whether {GSR} strengthens or weakens associations between resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC}) and multiple behavioral measures across cognition, personality and emotion. By applying the variance component model to the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project ({GSP}), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain {RSFC} increased by an average of 47\% across 23 behavioral measures after {GSR}. In the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain {RSFC} increased by an average of 40\% across 58 behavioral measures, when {GSR} was applied after {ICA}-{FIX} de-noising. To ensure generalizability, we repeated our analyses using kernel regression. {GSR} improved behavioral prediction accuracies by an average of 64\% and 12\% in the {GSP} and {HCP} datasets respectively. Importantly, the results were consistent across methods. A behavioral measure with greater {RSFC}-explained variance (using the variance component model) also exhibited greater prediction accuracy (using kernel regression). A behavioral measure with greater improvement in behavioral variance explained after {GSR} (using the variance component model) also enjoyed greater improvement in prediction accuracy after {GSR} (using kernel regression). Furthermore, {GSR} appeared to benefit task performance measures more than self-reported measures. Since {GSR} was more effective at removing motion-related and respiratory-related artifacts, {GSR}-related increases in variance explained and prediction accuracies were unlikely the result of motion-related or respiratory-related artifacts. However, it is worth emphasizing that the current study focused on whole-brain {RSFC}, so it remains unclear whether {GSR} improves {RSFC}-behavioral associations for specific connections or networks. Overall, our results suggest that at least in the case for young healthy adults, {GSR} strengthens the associations between {RSFC} and most (although not all) behavioral measures.

Brain networks were defined using a data-driven group-independent component analysis and a dynamic connectivity analysis with a sliding window technique was applied. The network centrality parameters of the dynamic brain networks were extracted from each brain network and they were correlated to eating behavior and {BMI} scores. The network parameters of the executive control network showed a strong correlation with eating behavior and {BMI} scores only when a dynamic (p \textless 0.05), not static (p \textgreater 0.05), connectivity analysis was adopted.

Here, using resting-state {fMRI} and 58 phenotypic measures from the Human Connectome Project, we find that dynamic {FC} captures task-based phenotypes (e.g., processing speed or fluid intelligence scores), whereas self-reported measures (e.g., loneliness or life satisfaction) are equally well explained by static and dynamic {FC}.

abstract = {Estimation of functional connectivity ({FC}) has become an increasingly powerful tool for investigating healthy and abnormal brain function. Static connectivity, in particular, has played a large part in guiding conclusions from the majority of resting-state functional {MRI} studies. However, accumulating evidence points to the presence of temporal fluctuations in {FC}, leading to increasing interest in estimating {FC} as a dynamic quantity. One central issue that has arisen in this new view of connectivity is the dramatic increase in complexity caused by dynamic functional connectivity ({dFC}) estimation. To computationally handle this increased complexity, a limited set of {dFC} properties, primarily the mean and variance, have generally been considered. Additionally, it remains unclear how to integrate the increased information from {dFC} into pattern recognition techniques for subject-level prediction. In this study, we propose an approach to address these two issues based on a large number of previously unexplored temporal and spectral features of dynamic functional connectivity. A Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity ({GARCH}) model is used to estimate time-varying patterns of functional connectivity between resting-state networks. Time-frequency analysis is then performed on {dFC} estimates, and a large number of previously unexplored temporal and spectral features drawn from signal processing literature are extracted for {dFC} estimates. We apply the investigated features to two neurologic populations of interest, healthy controls and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, and show that the proposed approach leads to substantial increases in predictive performance compared to both traditional estimates of static connectivity as well as current approaches to {dFC}. Variable importance is assessed and shows that there are several quantities that can be extracted from {dFC} signal which are more informative than the traditional mean or variance of {dFC}. This work illuminates many previously unexplored facets of the dynamic properties of functional connectivity between resting-state networks, and provides a platform for dynamic functional connectivity analysis that facilitates its usage as an investigative measure for healthy as well as abnormal brain function.}

The classifier, which was trained on 1 sample and tested on the other 2, was able to reliably classify sex, both within sample and across independent samples, differing both with respect to imaging parameters and sample characteristics. Brain regions displaying highest sex classification accuracies were mainly located along the cingulate cortex, medial and lateral frontal cortex, temporoparietal regions, insula, and precuneus. These areas were stable across samples and match well with previously described sex differences in functional brain organization.

For this purpose, Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool ({TPOT}) was developed using strongly typed genetic programing ({GP}) to recommend an optimized analysis pipeline for the data scientist's prediction problem. However, like other {AutoML} systems, {TPOT} may reach computational resource limits when working on big data such as whole-genome expression data. {RESULTS}: We introduce two new features implemented in {TPOT} that helps increase the system's scalability: Feature Set Selector ({F\SS}) and Template. {F\SS} provides the option to specify subsets of the features as separate datasets, assuming the signals come from one or more of these specific data subsets. {F\SS} increases {TPOT}'s efficiency in application on big data by slicing the entire dataset into smaller sets of features and allowing {GP} to select the best subset in the final pipeline. Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed {GP} and enables the incorporation of {F\SS} at the beginning of each pipeline. Consequently, {F\SS} and Template help reduce {TPOT} computation time and may provide more interpretable results. Our simulations show {TPOT}-{F\SS} significantly outperforms a tuned {XGBoost} model and standard {TPOT} implementation. We apply {TPOT}-{F\SS} to real {RNA}-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder. Independent of the previous study that identified significant association with depression severity of two modules, {TPOT}-{F\SS} corroborates that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Detailed simulation and analysis code needed to reproduce the results in this study is available at https://github.com/lelaboratoire/tpot-fss.

The specific {ML} regression algorithm and sample size are two key factors that non-trivially influence prediction accuracies. However, the effects of the {ML} regression algorithm and sample size on individualized behavioral/cognitive prediction performance have not been comprehensively assessed. To address this issue, the present study included six commonly used {ML} regression algorithms: ordinary least squares ({OLS}) regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ({LA\SSO}) regression, ridge regression, elastic-net regression, linear support vector regression ({LSVR}), and relevance vector regression ({RVR}), to perform specific behavioral/cognitive predictions based on different sample sizes. Specifically, the publicly available resting-state functional {MRI} (rs-{fMRI}) dataset from the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}) was used, and whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity ({rsFC}) or {rsFC} strength ({rsFCS}) were extracted as prediction features. Twenty-five sample sizes (ranged from 20 to 700) were studied by sub-sampling from the entire {HCP} cohort. The analyses showed that {rsFC}-based {LA\SSO} regression performed remarkably worse than the other algorithms, and {rsFCS}-based {OLS} regression performed markedly worse than the other algorithms. Regardless of the algorithm and feature type, both the prediction accuracy and its stability exponentially increased with increasing sample size. The specific patterns of the observed algorithm and sample size effects were well replicated in the prediction using re-testing {fMRI} data, data processed by different imaging preprocessing schemes, and different behavioral/cognitive scores, thus indicating excellent robustness/generalization of the effects. The current findings provide critical insight into how the selected {ML} regression algorithm and sample size influence individualized predictions of behavior/cognition and offer important guidance for choosing the {ML} regression algorithm or sample size in relevant investigations.

Yet, when it comes to dynamic {FC} ({dFC}) during rest, there is no consensus about its origin or significance. Some argue that rest {dFC} reflects fluctuations in on-going cognition, or is a manifestation of intrinsic brain maintenance mechanisms, which could have predictive clinical value. Conversely, others have concluded that rest {dFC} is mostly the result of sampling variability, head motion or fluctuating sleep states. Here, we present novel analyses suggesting that rest {dFC} is influenced by short periods of spontaneous cognitive-task-like processes, and that the cognitive nature of such mental processes can be inferred blindly from the data. As such, several different behaviorally relevant whole-brain {FC} configurations may occur during a single rest scan even when subjects were continuously awake and displayed minimal motion. In addition, using low dimensional embeddings as visualization aids, we show how {FC} states-commonly used to summarize and interpret resting {dFC}-can accurately and robustly reveal periods of externally imposed tasks; however, they may be less effective in capturing periods of distinct cognition during rest.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Disentangling psychopathological heterogeneity in schizophrenia is challenging, and previous results remain inconclusive. We employed advanced machine learning to identify a stable and generalizable factorization of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and used it to identify psychopathological subtypes as well as their neurobiological differentiations. {METHODS}: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale data from the Pharmacotherapy Monitoring and Outcome Survey cohort (1545 patients; 586 followed up after 1.35 ± 0.70 years) were used for learning the factor structure by an orthonormal projective non-negative factorization. An international sample, pooled from 9 medical centers across Europe, the United States, and Asia (490 patients), was used for validation. Patients were clustered into psychopathological subtypes based on the identified factor structure, and the neurobiological divergence between the subtypes was assessed by classification analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity patterns. {RESULTS}: A 4-factor structure representing negative, positive, affective, and cognitive symptoms was identified as the most stable and generalizable representation of psychopathology. It showed higher internal consistency than the original Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale subscales and previously proposed factor models. Based on this representation, the positive-negative dichotomy was confirmed as the (only) robust psychopathological subtypes, and these subtypes were longitudinally stable in about 80\% of the repeatedly assessed patients. Finally, the individual subtype could be predicted with good accuracy from functional connectivity profiles of the ventromedial frontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and precuneus. {CONCLUSIONS}: Machine learning applied to multisite data with cross-validation yielded a factorization generalizable across populations and medical systems. Together with subtyping and the demonstrated ability to predict subtype membership from neuroimaging data, this work further disentangles the heterogeneity in schizophrenia.

This study examined 2013 9-10 year olds in the first data release from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 21-site consortium study in order to identify resting state functional connectivity patterns that predict individual-differences in three domains of higher-order cognitive functions: General Ability, Speed/Flexibility, and Learning/Memory. For General Ability scores in particular, we observed consistent cross-site generalizability, with statistically significant predictions in 14 out of 15 held-out sites. These results survived several tests for robustness including replication in split-half analysis and in a low head motion subsample. We additionally found that connectivity patterns involving task control networks and default mode network were prominently implicated in predicting differences in General Ability across participants. These findings demonstrate that resting state connectivity can be leveraged to produce generalizable markers of neurocognitive functioning. Additionally, they highlight the importance of task control-default mode network interconnections as a major locus of individual differences in cognitive functioning in early adolescence.}

abstract = {Subclinical depression ({SD}) has been considered as the precursor to major depressive disorder. Accurate prediction of {SD} and identification of its etiological origin are urgent. Bursts within the lateral habenula ({LHb}) drive depression in rats, but whether dysfunctional {LHb} is associated with {SD} in human is unknown. Here we develop connectome-based biomarkers which predict {SD} and identify dysfunctional brain regions and connections. T1 weighted images and resting-state functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) data were collected from 34 subjects with {SD} and 40 healthy controls ({HCs}). After the brain is parcellated into 48 brain regions (246 subregions) using the human Brainnetome Atlas, the functional network of each participant is constructed by calculating the correlation coefficient for the time series of {fMRI} signals of each pair of subregions. Initial candidates of abnormal connections are identified by the two-sample t-test and input into Support Vector Machine models as features. A total of 24 anatomical-region-based models, 231 sliding-window-based models, and 100 random-selection-based models are built. The performance of these models is estimated through leave-one-out cross-validation and evaluated by measures of accuracy, sensitivity, confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the curve ({AUC}). After confirming the region with the highest accuracy, subregions within the thalamus and connections associated with subregions of {LHb} are compared. It is found that five prediction models using connections of the thalamus, posterior superior temporal sulcus, cingulate gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and superior frontal gyrus achieve an accuracy \textgreater0.9 and an {AUC} \textgreater0.93. Among 90 abnormal connections associated with the thalamus, the subregion of the right posterior parietal thalamus where {LHb} is located has the most connections (n = 18), the left subregion only has 3 connections. In {SD} group, 10 subregions in the thalamus have significantly different node degrees with those in the {HC} group, while 8 subregions have lower degrees ( p \textless 0.01), including the one with {LHb}. These results implicate abnormal brain connections associated with the thalamus and {LHb} to be associated with {SD}. Integration of these connections by machine learning can provide connectome-based biomarkers to accurately diagnose {SD}.}

abstract = {Studies comparing diverse groups have shown that many psychiatric diseases involve disruptions across distributed large-scale networks of the brain. There is hope that functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) functional connectivity techniques will shed light on these disruptions, providing prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers as well as targets for therapeutic interventions. However, to date, progress on clinical translation of {fMRI} methods has been limited. Here, we argue that this limited translation is driven by a combination of intersubject heterogeneity and the relatively low reliability of standard {fMRI} techniques at the individual level. We review a potential solution to these limitations: the use of new "precision" {fMRI} approaches that shift the focus of analysis from groups to single individuals through the use of extended data acquisition strategies. We begin by discussing the potential advantages of {fMRI} functional connectivity methods for improving our understanding of functional neuroanatomy and disruptions in psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the budding field of precision {fMRI} and findings garnered from this work. We demonstrate that precision {fMRI} can improve the reliability of functional connectivity measures, while showing high stability and sensitivity to individual differences. We close by discussing the application of these approaches to clinical settings. Copyright \copyright 2019 Society of Biological Psychiatry. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Importance: Great interest exists in identifying methods to predict neuropsychiatric disease states and treatment outcomes from high-dimensional data, including neuroimaging and genomics data. The goal of this review is to highlight several potential problems that can arise in studies that aim to establish prediction. Observations: A number of neuroimaging studies have claimed to establish prediction while establishing only correlation, which is an inappropriate use of the statistical meaning of prediction. Statistical associations do not necessarily imply the ability to make predictions in a generalized manner; establishing evidence for prediction thus requires testing of the model on data separate from those used to estimate the model's parameters. This article discusses various measures of predictive performance and the limitations of some commonly used measures, with a focus on the importance of using multiple measures when assessing performance. For classification, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is an appropriate measure; for regression analysis, correlation should be avoided, and median absolute error is preferred. Conclusions and Relevance: To ensure accurate estimates of predictive validity, the recommended best practices for predictive modeling include the following: (1) in-sample model fit indices should not be reported as evidence for predictive accuracy, (2) the cross-validation procedure should encompass all operations applied to the data, (3) prediction analyses should not be performed with samples smaller than several hundred observations, (4) multiple measures of prediction accuracy should be examined and reported, (5) the coefficient of determination should be computed using the sums of squares formulation and not the correlation coefficient, and (6) k-fold cross-validation rather than leave-one-out cross-validation should be used.}

abstract = {There is significant interest in the development and application of deep neural networks ({DNNs}) to neuroimaging data. A growing literature suggests that {DNNs} outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three {DNN} architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC}) patterns. One of the {DNNs} was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two {DNNs} were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}) and {UK} Biobank, we showed that the three {DNNs} and kernel regression achieved similar performance across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific {DNNs}. When predicting fluid intelligence in the {UK} Biobank, performance of all algorithms dramatically improved when sample size increased from 100 to 1000 subjects. Improvement was smaller, but still significant, when sample size increased from 1000 to 5000 subjects. Importantly, kernel regression was competitive across all sample sizes. Overall, our study suggests that kernel regression is as effective as {DNNs} for {RSFC}-based behavioral prediction, while incurring significantly lower computational costs. Therefore, kernel regression might serve as a useful baseline algorithm for future studies. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

Knowledge of the spatiotemporal organization of these interactions is critical for establishing a solid understanding of the brain's functional architecture and the relationship between neural dynamics and cognition in health and disease. The possibility of studying these dynamics through careful analysis of neuroimaging data has catalyzed substantial interest in methods that estimate time-resolved fluctuations in functional connectivity (often referred to as "dynamic" or time-varying functional connectivity; {TVFC}). At the same time, debates have emerged regarding the application of {TVFC} analyses to resting {fMRI} data, and about the statistical validity, physiological origins, and cognitive and behavioral relevance of resting {TVFC}. These and other unresolved issues complicate interpretation of resting {TVFC} findings and limit the insights that can be gained from this promising new research area.

A better characterization of the features underlying successful fingerprinting performance-how many and which functional connections are necessary and/or sufficient for high accuracy-will further inform our understanding of uniqueness in brain functioning. Thus, here we examine the limits of high-accuracy individual identification from functional connectomes. Using ∼3,300 scans from the Human Connectome Project in a split-half design and an independent replication sample, we find that a remarkably small "thin slice" of the connectome-as few as 40 out of 64,620 functional connections-was sufficient to uniquely identify individuals. Yet, we find that no specific connections or even specific networks were necessary for identification, as even small random samples of the connectome were sufficient. These results have important conceptual and practical implications for the manifestation and detection of uniqueness in the brain.}

abstract = {A major goal of neuroimaging studies is to develop predictive models to analyze the relationship between whole brain functional connectivity patterns and behavioural traits. However, there is no single widely-accepted standard pipeline for analyzing functional connectivity. The common procedure for designing functional connectivity based predictive models entails three main steps: parcellating the brain, estimating the interaction between defined parcels, and lastly, using these integrated associations between brain parcels as features fed to a classifier for predicting non-imaging variables e.g., behavioural traits, demographics, emotional measures, etc. There are also additional considerations when using correlation-based measures of functional connectivity, resulting in three supplementary steps: utilising Riemannian geometry tangent space parameterization to preserve the geometry of functional connectivity; penalizing the connectivity estimates with shrinkage approaches to handle challenges related to short time-series (and noisy) data; and removing confounding variables from brain-behaviour data. These six steps are contingent on each-other, and to optimise a general framework one should ideally examine these various methods simultaneously. In this paper, we investigated strengths and short-comings, both independently and jointly, of the following measures: parcellation techniques of four kinds (categorized further depending upon number of parcels), five measures of functional connectivity, the decision of staying in the ambient space of connectivity matrices or in tangent space, the choice of applying shrinkage estimators, six alternative techniques for handling confounds and finally four novel classifiers/predictors. For performance evaluation, we have selected two of the largest datasets, {UK} Biobank and the Human Connectome Project resting state {fMRI} data, and have run more than 9000 different pipeline variants on a total of ∼14000 individuals to determine the optimum pipeline. For independent performance validation, we have run some best-performing pipeline variants on {ABIDE} and {ACPI} datasets (∼1000 subjects) to evaluate the generalisability of proposed network modelling methods.

These studies maintain a focus on decoding individual differences in a continuously behavioral phenotype from neuroimaging data, opening up an exciting opportunity to describe the human brain at the single-subject level. In this survey, we provide an overview of recent studies that utilize machine learning approaches to identify neuroimaging predictors over the past decade. We first review regression-based approaches and highlight connectome-based predictive modeling, which has grown in popularity in recent years. Next, we systematically describe recent representative studies using these tools in the context of cognitive function, symptom severity, personality traits, and emotion processing. Finally, we highlight a few challenges related to combining multimodal data, longitudinal prediction, external validations, and the employment of deep learning methods that have emerged from our review of the existing literature, as well as present some promising and challenging future directions.

abstract = {The Human Connectome Projects in Development ({HCP}-D) and Aging ({HCP}-A) are two large-scale brain imaging studies that will extend the recently completed {HCP} Young-Adult ({HCP}-{YA}) project to nearly the full lifespan, collecting structural, resting-state {fMRI}, task-{fMRI}, diffusion, and perfusion {MRI} in participants from 5 to 100+ years of age. {HCP}-D is enrolling 1300+ healthy children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 5-21), and {HCP}-A is enrolling 1200+ healthy adults (ages 36-100+), with each study collecting longitudinal data in a subset of individuals at particular age ranges. The imaging protocols of the {HCP}-D and {HCP}-A studies are very similar, differing primarily in the selection of different task-{fMRI} paradigms. We strove to harmonize the imaging protocol to the greatest extent feasible with the completed {HCP}-{YA} (1200+ participants, aged 22-35), but some imaging-related changes were motivated or necessitated by hardware changes, the need to reduce the total amount of scanning per participant, and/or the additional challenges of working with young and elderly populations. Here, we provide an overview of the common {HCP}-D/A imaging protocol including data and rationales for protocol decisions and changes relative to {HCP}-{YA}. The result will be a large, rich, multi-modal, and freely available set of consistently acquired data for use by the scientific community to investigate and define normative developmental and aging related changes in the healthy human brain.

Here, we report on a new study designed to either better differentiate {ASD} from {TD} functional connectomes-or, alternatively, to refine our understanding of the factors underlying the current state of affairs. We scanned individuals with {ASD} and controls both at rest and while watching videos with social content. Using multiband {fMRI} across repeat sessions, we improved both data quantity and scanning duration by collecting up to 2 hr of data per individual. This is about 50 times the typical number of temporal samples per individual in {ASD} {fcMRI} studies. We obtained functional connectomes that were discriminable, allowing for near-perfect individual identification regardless of diagnosis, and equally reliable in both groups. However, contrary to what one might expect, we did not consistently or robustly observe in the {ASD} group either reductions in similarity to {TD} functional connectivity ({FC}) patterns or shared atypical {FC} patterns. Accordingly, {FC}-based predictions of diagnosis group achieved accuracy levels around chance. However, using the same approaches to predict scan type (rest vs. video) achieved near-perfect accuracy. Our findings suggest that neither the limitations of resting state as a "task," data resolution, data quantity, or scan duration can be considered solely responsible for failures to differentiate {ASD} from {TD} functional connectomes. \copyright 2020 The Authors.

abstract = {Since working memory deficits in schizophrenia have been linked to negative symptoms, we tested whether features of the one could predict the treatment outcome in the other. Specifically, we hypothesized that working memory-related functional connectivity at pre-treatment can predict improvement of negative symptoms in antipsychotic-treated patients. Fourteen antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia were clinically assessed before and after 7 months of quetiapine monotherapy. At baseline, patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a verbal n-back task. Spatial independent component analysis identified task-modulated brain networks. A linear support vector machine was trained with these components to discriminate six patients who showed improvement in negative symptoms from eight non-improvers. Classification accuracy and significance was estimated by leave-one-out cross-validation and permutation tests, respectively. Two frontoparietal and one default mode network components predicted negative symptom improvement with a classification accuracy of 79\% (p = 0.003). Discriminating features were found in the frontoparietal networks but not the default mode network. These preliminary data suggest that functional patterns at baseline can predict negative symptom treatment-response in schizophrenia. This information may be used to stratify patients into subgroups thereby facilitating personalized treatment.}

Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2-5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.}

abstract = {Background: Fluid intelligence declines with advancing age, starting in early adulthood. Within-subject declines in fluid intelligence are highly correlated with contemporaneous declines in the ability to live and function independently. To support healthy aging, the mechanisms underlying these declines need to be better understood. Methods: In this pre-registered analysis, we applied latent growth curve modelling to investigate the neural determinants of longitudinal changes in fluid intelligence across three time points in 185,317 individuals (N=9,719 two waves, N=870 three waves) from the {UK} Biobank (age range: 39-73 years). Results: We found a weak but significant effect of cross-sectional age on the mean fluid intelligence score, such that older individuals scored slightly lower. However, the mean longitudinal slope was positive, rather than negative, suggesting improvement across testing occasions. Despite the considerable sample size, the slope variance was non-significant, suggesting no reliable individual differences in change over time. This null-result is likely due to the nature of the cognitive test used. In a subset of individuals, we found that white matter microstructure (N=8839, as indexed by fractional anisotropy) and grey-matter volume (N=9931) in pre-defined regions-of-interest accounted for complementary and unique variance in mean fluid intelligence scores. The strongest effects were such that higher grey matter volume in the frontal pole and greater white matter microstructure in the posterior thalamic radiations were associated with higher fluid intelligence scores. Conclusions: In a large preregistered analysis, we demonstrate a weak but significant negative association between age and fluid intelligence. However, we did not observe plausible longitudinal patterns, instead observing a weak increase across testing occasions, and no significant individual differences in rates of change, likely due to the suboptimal task design. Finally, we find support for our preregistered expectation that white- and grey matter make separate contributions to individual differences in fluid intelligence beyond age.}

In this paper we performed principal component analyses of the neurocognitive assessments administered to the baseline sample. The neurocognitive battery included seven measures from the {NIH} Toolbox as well as five other tasks. We implemented a Bayesian Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis ({BPPCA}) model that incorporated nesting of subjects within families and within data collection sites. We extracted varimax-rotated component scores from a three-component model and associated these scores with parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist ({CBCL}) internalizing, externalizing, and stress reactivity. We found evidence for three broad components that encompass general cognitive ability, executive function, and learning/memory. These were significantly associated with {CBCL} scores in a differential manner but with small effect sizes. These findings set the stage for longitudinal analysis of neurocognitive and psychopathological data from the {ABCD} cohort as they age into the period of maximal adolescent risk-taking.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is a progressive neurological disorder in which the death of brain cells causes memory loss and cognitive decline. The identification of at-risk subjects yet showing no dementia symptoms but who will later convert to {AD} can be crucial for the effective treatment of {AD}. For this, Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI}) is expected to play a crucial role. During recent years, several Machine Learning ({ML}) approaches to {AD}-conversion prediction have been proposed using different types of {MRI} features. However, few studies comparing these different feature representations exist, and the existing ones do not allow to make definite conclusions. We evaluated the performance of various types of {MRI} features for the conversion prediction: voxel-based features extracted based on voxel-based morphometry, hippocampus volumes, volumes of the entorhinal cortex, and a set of regional volumetric, surface area, and cortical thickness measures across the brain. Regional features consistently yielded the best performance over two classifiers (Support Vector Machines and Regularized Logistic Regression), and two datasets studied. However, the performance difference to other features was not statistically significant. There was a consistent trend of age correction improving the classification performance, but the improvement reached statistical significance only rarely. Copyright \copyright 2018 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The identifiability framework (𝕀f) has been shown to improve differential identifiability (reliability across-sessions and -sites, and differentiability across-subjects) of functional connectomes for a variety of {fMRI} tasks. But having a robust single session/subject functional connectome is just the starting point to subsequently assess network properties for characterizing properties of integration, segregation, and communicability, among others. Naturally, one wonders whether uncovering identifiability at the connectome level also uncovers identifiability on the derived network properties. This also raises the question of where to apply the 𝕀f framework: on the connectivity data or directly on each network measurement? Our work answers these questions by exploring the differential identifiability profiles of network measures when 𝕀f is applied (a) on the functional connectomes, and (b) directly on derived network measurements. Results show that improving across-session reliability of functional connectomes ({FCs}) also improves reliability of derived network measures. We also find that, for specific network properties, application of 𝕀f directly on network properties is more effective. Finally, we discover that applying the framework, either way, increases task sensitivity of network properties. At a time when the neuroscientific community is focused on subject-level inferences, this framework is able to uncover {FC} fingerprints, which propagate to derived network properties. \copyright 2020 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.}

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) continues to drive many important neuroscientific advances. However, progress in uncovering reproducible associations between individual differences in brain structure/function and behavioral phenotypes (e.g., cognition, mental health) may have been undermined by typical neuroimaging sample sizes (median N=25)1,2. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ({ABCD}) Study3 (N=11,878), we estimated the effect sizes and reproducibility of these brain wide associations studies ({BWAS}) as a function of sample size. The very largest, replicable brain wide associations for univariate and multivariate methods were r=0.14 and r=0.34, respectively. In smaller samples, typical for brain wide association studies, irreproducible, inflated effect sizes were ubiquitous, no matter the method (univariate, multivariate). Until sample sizes started to approach consortium levels, {BWAS} were underpowered and statistical errors assured. Multiple factors contribute to replication failures4,5,6; here, we show that the pairing of small brain behavioral phenotype effect sizes with sampling variability is a key element in widespread {BWAS} replication failure. Brain behavioral phenotype associations stabilize and become more reproducible with sample sizes of N\textgreater2,000. While investigator initiated brain behavior research continues to generate hypotheses and propel innovation, large consortia are needed to usher in a new era of reproducible human brain wide association studies.}

abstract = {Functional connectivity ({FC}) calculated from task {fMRI} data better reveals brain-phenotype relationships than rest-based {FC}, but how tasks have this effect is unknown. In over 700 individuals performing seven tasks, we use psychophysiological interaction ({PPI}) and predictive modeling analyses to demonstrate that task-induced changes in {FC} successfully predict phenotype, and these changes are not simply driven by task activation. Activation, however, is useful for prediction only if the in-scanner task is related to the predicted phenotype. To further characterize these predictive {FC} changes, we develop and apply an inter-subject {PPI} analysis. We find that moderate, but not high, task-induced consistency of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent ({BOLD}) signal across individuals is useful for prediction. Together, these findings demonstrate that in-scanner tasks have distributed, phenotypically relevant effects on brain functional organization, and they offer a framework to leverage both task activation and {FC} to reveal the neural bases of complex human traits, symptoms, and behaviors.

However, the multivariate nature of the prediction model based on connectivity within a network of brain regions severely limits the interpretation of the brain-behavior patterns from a cognitive neuroscience perspective.

Preliminary to the development of this region-wise machine learning approach, we performed an extensive assessment of the general {CBPP} framework based on whole-brain connectivity information. Because a systematic evaluation of different parameters was lacking from previous literature, we evaluated several approaches pertaining to the different steps of a {CBPP} study. We hence tested 72 different approach combinations in a cohort of over 900 healthy adults across 98 psychometric variables. Overall, our extensive evaluation combined to an innovative region-wise machine learning approach, offering a framework that optimizes both prediction performance and neurobiological validity (and hence interpretability) to study brain-behavior relationships.}

Similar to how brain age captures biological aging, intelligence and neuroticism may provide empirical proxies for mental health.

Here, we built proxy measures by applying machine learning on multimodal {MR} images and rich sociodemographic information from the largest brain-imaging cohort to date: the {UK} Biobank. Objective comparisons revealed that all proxies captured the target constructs and related to health-contributing habits beyond the measures they were derived from.

abstract = {The human brain is composed of regions that can be grouped into functionally specialized systems. These systems transiently couple and decouple across time to support complex cognitive processes. Recently, we proposed an edge-centric model of brain networks whose elements can be clustered to reveal communities of connections whose co-fluctuations are correlated across time. It remains unclear, however, how these co-fluctuation patterns relate to traditionally-defined brain systems. Here, we address this question using data from the Midnight Scan Club. We show that edge communities transcend traditional definitions of brain systems, forming a multiplexed network in which all pairs of brain systems are linked to one another by at least two distinct edge communities. Mapping edge communities back to individual brain regions and deriving a novel distance metric to describe the similarity of regions' ''edge community profiles'', we then demonstrate that the within-system similarity of profiles is heterogeneous across systems. Specifically, we find that heteromodal association areas exhibit significantly greater diversity of edge communities than primary sensory systems. Next, we cluster the entire cerebral cortex according to the similarity of regions' edge community profiles, revealing systematic differences between traditionally-defined systems and the detected clusters. Specifically, we find that regions in heteromodal systems exhibit dissimilar edge community profiles and are more likely to form their own clusters. Finally, we show show that edge communities are highly personalized and can be used to identify individual subjects. Collectively, our work reveals the pervasive overlap of edge communities across the cerebral cortex and characterizes their relationship with the brain's system level architecture. Our work provides clear pathways for future research using edge-centric brain networks to investigate individual differences in behavior, development, and disease.}

Although dysfunctions in resting-state functional connectivity have been reported in {IGD}, mapping relationships from abnormal connectivity patterns to behavioral measures have not been fully investigated. Connectome-based predictive modeling ({CPM})-a recently developed machine-learning approach-has been used to examine potential neural mechanisms in addictions and other psychiatric disorders. To identify the resting-state connections associated with {IGD}, we modified the {CPM} approach by replacing its core learning algorithm with a support vector machine. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data were acquired in 72 individuals with {IGD} and 41 healthy comparison participants. The modified {CPM} was conducted with respect to classification and regression. A comparison of whole-brain and network-based analyses showed that the default-mode network ({DMN}) is the most informative network in predicting {IGD} both in classification (individual identification accuracy = 78.76\%) and regression (correspondence between predicted and actual psychometric scale score: r = 0.44, P \textless  0.001). To facilitate the characterization of the aberrant resting-state activity in the {DMN}, the identified networks have been mapped into a three-subsystem division of the {DMN}. Results suggest that individual differences in {DMN} function at rest could advance our understanding of {IGD} and variability in disorder etiology and intervention outcomes. \copyright 2020 Society for the Study of Addiction.}

Using network analysis, we show that, at rest, {eFC} is consistent across datasets and reproducible within the same individual over multiple scan sessions. We demonstrate that clustering {eFC} yields communities of edges that naturally divide the brain into overlapping clusters, with regions in sensorimotor and attentional networks exhibiting the greatest levels of overlap. We show that {eFC} is systematically modulated by variation in sensory input.

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity is used throughout neuroscience to study brain organization and to generate biomarkers of development, disease, and cognition. The processes that give rise to correlated activity are, however, poorly understood. Here we decompose resting-state functional connectivity using a temporal unwrapping procedure to assess the contributions of moment-to-moment activity cofluctuations to the overall connectivity pattern. This approach temporally resolves functional connectivity at a timescale of single frames, which enables us to make direct comparisons of cofluctuations of network organization with fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) time series. We show that surprisingly, only a small fraction of frames exhibiting the strongest cofluctuation amplitude are required to explain a significant fraction of variance in the overall pattern of connection weights as well as the network's modular structure. These frames coincide with frames of high {BOLD} activity amplitude, corresponding to activity patterns that are remarkably consistent across individuals and identify fluctuations in default mode and control network activity as the primary driver of resting-state functional connectivity. Finally, we demonstrate that cofluctuation amplitude synchronizes across subjects during movie watching and that high-amplitude frames carry detailed information about individual subjects (whereas low-amplitude frames carry little). Our approach reveals fine-scale temporal structure of resting-state functional connectivity and discloses that frame-wise contributions vary across time. These observations illuminate the relation of brain activity to functional connectivity and open a number of directions for future research. Copyright \copyright 2020 the Author(s).

Here, we proposed the use of an end-to-end deep learning model that combines the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) and long short-term memory ({LSTM}) network to capture temporal and spatial features of functional connectivity sequences simultaneously. The results on a large cohort (Human Connectome Project, n = 1,050) demonstrated that our model could achieve a high classification accuracy of about 93\% in a gender classification task and prediction accuracies of 0.31 and 0.49 (Pearson's correlation coefficient) in fluid and crystallized intelligence prediction tasks, significantly outperforming previously reported models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our model could effectively learn spatiotemporal dynamics underlying {dFC} with high statistical significance based on the null hypothesis estimated using surrogate data.

Using structural, functional and diffusion-weighted {MRI} acquired in 1000 healthy adults, we aimed to map the cortical correlates of identity and behavior at ultra-high spatial resolution. Using methods based on sparse matrix representations, we propose a computationally feasible high-resolution connectomic approach that improves neural fingerprinting and behavior prediction. Using this high-resolution approach, we find that the multimodal cortical gradients of individual uniqueness reside in the association cortices. Furthermore, our analyses identified a striking dichotomy between the facets of a person's neural identity that best predict their behavior and cognition, compared to those that best differentiate them from other individuals. Functional connectivity was one of the most accurate predictors of behavior, yet resided among the weakest differentiators of identity; whereas the converse was found for morphological properties, such as cortical curvature. This study provides new insights into the neural basis of personal identity and new tools to facilitate ultra-high-resolution connectomics. Copyright \copyright 2021 The Author(s).

We have previously developed a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model ({MS}-{HBM}) for estimating high-quality individual-specific network-level parcellations. Here, we extend the model to estimate individual-specific areal-level parcellations. While network-level parcellations comprise spatially distributed networks spanning the cortex, the consensus is that areal-level parcels should be spatially localized, i.e., should not span multiple lobes. There is disagreement about whether areal-level parcels should be strictly contiguous or comprise multiple non-contiguous components, therefore we considered three areal-level {MS}-{HBM} variants spanning these range of possibilities. Individual-specific {MS}-{HBM} parcellations estimated using 10min of data generalized better than other approaches using 150min of data to out-of-sample rs-{fMRI} and task-{fMRI} from the same individuals. Resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC}) derived from {MS}-{HBM} parcellations also achieved the best behavioral prediction performance. Among the three {MS}-{HBM} variants, the strictly contiguous {MS}-{HBM} ({cMS}-{HBM}) exhibited the best resting-state homogeneity and most uniform within-parcel task activation. In terms of behavioral prediction, the gradient-infused {MS}-{HBM} ({gMS}-{HBM}) was numerically the best, but differences among {MS}-{HBM} variants were not statistically significant. Overall, these results suggest that areal-level {MS}-{HBMs} can capture behaviorally meaningful individual-specific parcellation features beyond group-level parcellations.

One method that harnesses such individual signatures is functional connectome fingerprinting, which can reliably identify individuals from large study populations. While connectome fingerprints have been previously associated with individual cognitive function, these associations rest on indirect evidence. Contrasting with these previous reports, here we systematically investigate the link between connectome fingerprints and the prediction of behaviour on different levels of brain network organisation (individual edges, network interactions, topographical organisation and edge variability), using 339 resting-state {fMRI} datasets from the Human Connectome Project. Our analysis revealed a significant divergence between connectivity signatures that discriminate between individuals and those predictive of behaviour on all levels of network organisation. Across different parcellation schemes, thresholds and prediction algorithms, we consistently find fingerprints in higher-order multimodal association cortices, while neural correlates of behaviour display a more variable topological distribution. Furthermore, we find the standard deviation of connections between subjects to be significantly higher in fingerprinting than in prediction, making inter-individual connection variability a possible separating marker. These results demonstrate that participant identification and behavioural prediction involve highly distinct functional systems of the human connectome, suggesting that connectome fingerprints are not as functionally relevant as previously believed. The present study thus calls for a re-evaluation of the significance of functional connectivity fingerprints in personalized medicine.}

Such behavioral success stands in striking contrast to the apparent instability in neural activity (i.e., variability) from which it arises. Here, we summon the considerable evidence across scales, species, and imaging modalities that neural variability represents a key, undervalued dimension for understanding brain-behavior relationships at inter- and intra-individual levels. We believe that only by incorporating a specific focus on variability will the neural foundation of behavior be comprehensively understood. Copyright \copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Recent studies found low test-retest reliability in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), raising serious concerns among researchers, but these studies mostly focused on the reliability of individual {fMRI} features (e.g., individual connections in resting state connectivity maps). Meanwhile, neuroimaging researchers increasingly employ multivariate predictive models that aggregate information across a large number of features to predict outcomes of interest, but the test-retest reliability of predicted outcomes of these models has not previously been systematically studied. Here we apply 10 predictive modeling methods to resting state connectivity maps from the Human Connectome Project dataset to predict 61 outcome variables. Compared with mean reliability of individual resting state connections, we find mean reliability of the predicted outcomes of predictive models is substantially higher for all 10 modeling methods assessed. Moreover, improvement was consistently observed across all scanning and processing choices (i.e., scan lengths, censoring thresholds, volume- vs. surface-based processing). For the most reliable methods, the reliability of predicted outcomes was mostly, though not exclusively, in the "good" range (above 0.60). Finally, we identified three mechanisms that help to explain why predicted outcomes of predictive models have higher reliability than individual imaging features. We conclude that researchers can potentially achieve higher test-retest reliability by making greater use of predictive models. \copyright The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) methods are increasingly being used to predict pathologies and biological traits using neuroimaging data. Here controlling for confounds is essential to get unbiased estimates of generalization performance and to identify the features driving predictions. However, a systematic evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of available alternatives is lacking. This makes it difficult to compare results across studies and to build deployment quality models. Here, we evaluated two commonly used confound removal schemes–whole data confound regression ({WDCR}) and cross-validated confound regression ({CVCR})–to understand their effectiveness and biases induced in generalization performance estimation. Additionally, we study the interaction of the confound removal schemes with Z-score normalization, a common practice in {ML} modelling. We applied eight combinations of confound removal schemes and normalization (pipelines) to decode sex from resting-state functional {MRI} ({rfMRI}) data while controlling for two confounds, brain size and age. We show that both schemes effectively remove linear univariate and multivariate confounding effects resulting in reduced model performance with {CVCR} providing better generalization estimates, i.e., closer to out-of-sample performance than {WDCR}. We found no effect of normalizing before or after confound removal. In the presence of dataset and confound shift, four tested confound removal procedures yielded mixed results, raising new questions. We conclude that {CVCR} is a better method to control for confounding effects in neuroimaging studies. We believe that our in-depth analyses shed light on choices associated with confound removal and hope that it generates more interest in this problem instrumental to numerous applications.}

We discuss three avenues of research that are overcoming this limitation: (i) the adoption of transdiagnostic research designs, which involve studying and explicitly comparing multiple disorders from distinct diagnostic axes of psychiatry; (ii) dimensional models of psychopathology that map the full spectrum of symptomatology and that cut across traditional disorder boundaries; and (iii) modeling individuals' unique functional connectomes throughout development.

Here, we combine psychometric and machine learning methods to examine in a data-driven manner how factor structure and individual variability in cognitive-task performance relate to dynamic-network connectomics. We report that 12 sub-tasks from an established intelligence test can be accurately multi-way classified (74\%, chance 8.3\%) based on the network states that they evoke. The proximities of the tasks in behavioural-psychometric space correlate with the similarities of their network states. Furthermore, the network states were more accurately classified for higher relative to lower performing individuals. These results suggest that the human brain uses a high-dimensional network-sampling mechanism to flexibly code for diverse cognitive tasks. Population variability in intelligence test performance relates to the fidelity of expression of these task-optimised network states.}

abstract = {Functional connectivity ({FC}) describes the statistical dependence between neuronal populations or brain regions in resting-state {fMRI} studies and is commonly estimated as the Pearson correlation of time courses. Clustering or community detection reveals densely coupled sets of regions constituting resting-state networks or functional systems. These systems manifest most clearly when {FC} is sampled over longer epochs but appear to fluctuate on shorter timescales. Here, we propose a new approach to reveal temporal fluctuations in neuronal time series. Unwrapping {FC} signal correlations yields pairwise co-fluctuation time series, one for each node pair or edge, and allows tracking of fine-scale dynamics across the network. Co-fluctuations partition the network, at each time step, into exactly two communities. Sampled over time, the overlay of these bipartitions, a binary decomposition of the original time series, very closely approximates functional connectivity. Bipartitions exhibit characteristic spatiotemporal patterns that are reproducible across participants and imaging runs, capture individual differences, and disclose fine-scale temporal expression of functional systems. Our findings document that functional systems appear transiently and intermittently, and that {FC} results from the overlay of many variable instances of system expression. Potential applications of this decomposition of functional connectivity into a set of binary patterns are discussed. \copyright 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.}

abstract = {Chronic low back pain ({LBP}) is a very common health problem worldwide and a major cause of disability. Yet, the lack of quantifiable metrics on which to base clinical decisions leads to imprecise treatments, unnecessary surgery and reduced patient outcomes. Although, the focus of {LBP} has largely focused on the spine, the literature demonstrates a robust reorganization of the human brain in the setting of {LBP}. Brain neuroimaging holds promise for the discovery of biomarkers that will improve the treatment of chronic {LBP}. In this study, we report on morphological changes in cerebral cortical thickness ({CT}) and resting-state functional connectivity ({rsFC}) measures as potential brain biomarkers for {LBP}. Structural {MRI} scans, resting state functional {MRI} scans and self-reported clinical scores were collected from 24 {LBP} patients and 27 age-matched healthy controls ({HC}). The results suggest widespread differences in {CT} in {LBP} patients relative to {HC}. These differences in {CT} are correlated with self-reported clinical summary scores, the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores. The primary visual, secondary visual and default mode networks showed significant age-corrected increases in connectivity with multiple networks in {LBP} patients. Cortical regions classified as hubs based on their eigenvector centrality ({EC}) showed differences in their topology within motor and visual processing regions. Finally, a support vector machine trained using {CT} to classify {LBP} subjects from {HC} achieved an average classification accuracy of 74.51\%, {AUC} = 0.787 (95\% {CI}: 0.66-0.91). The findings from this study suggest widespread changes in {CT} and {rsFC} in patients with {LBP} while a machine learning algorithm trained using {CT} can predict patient group. Taken together, these findings suggest that {CT} and {rsFC} may act as potential biomarkers for {LBP} to guide therapy. Copyright \copyright 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we thus address how the parameters of diffusion-weighted data processing for structural connectivity ({SC}) can influence the validation results of the whole-brain mathematical models informed by {SC}. For this, we introduce a set of simulation conditions including the varying number of total streamlines of the whole-brain tractography ({WBT}) used for extraction of {SC}, cortical parcellations based on functional and anatomical brain properties and distinct model fitting modalities. The main objective of this study is to explore how the quality of the model validation can vary across the considered simulation conditions. We observed that the graph-theoretical network properties of structural connectome can be affected by varying tractography density and strongly relate to the model performance. We also found that the optimal number of the total streamlines of {WBT} can vary for different brain atlases. Consequently, we suggest a way how to improve the model performance based on the network properties and the optimal parameter configurations from multiple {WBT} conditions. Furthermore, the population of subjects can be stratified into subgroups with divergent behaviors induced by the varying {WBT} density such that different recommendations can be made with respect to the data processing for individual subjects and brain parcellations.

This study used a graph-based time-frame modularity analysis approach to identify temporally recurrent functional configuration patterns in neural responses to an n-back working memory task during {fMRI}. Working memory load was manipulated to investigate the functional relevance of the identified brain states. Four distinct brain states were defined by the predominant patterns of activation in the task-positive, default-mode, sensorimotor, and visual networks. Associated with escalating working memory load, the occurrence of the task-positive state and the probability of transitioning into this state increased. In contrast, the occurrence of the default-mode and sensorimotor states and the probability of these 2 states transitioning away from the task-positive state decreased. The task-positive state occurrence rate and the probability of transitioning from the default-mode state back to the task-positive state explained a significant and unique portion of the variance in task performance. The results demonstrate that dynamic brain activities support successful cognitive functioning and may have heuristic value for understanding abnormal cognitive functioning associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders.

At the same time, well-founded concerns over rigor and reproducibility in psychology and neuroscience have led many to question whether functional connectivity is sufficiently reliable, and call for methods to improve its reliability. The thesis of this opinion piece is that when studying variability in functional connectivity-both across individuals and within individuals over time-we should use behavior prediction as our benchmark rather than optimize reliability for its own sake. We discuss theoretical and empirical evidence to compel this perspective, both when the goal is to study stable, trait-level differences between people, as well as when the goal is to study state-related changes within individuals. We hope that this piece will be useful to the neuroimaging community as we continue efforts to characterize inter- and intra-subject variability in brain function and build predictive models with an eye toward eventual real-world applications.

To answer this question, we capitalize on a large data sample from the Human Connectome Project and rigorously investigate the contribution of the aforementioned processes on functional connectivity ({FC}) and time-varying {FC}, as well as their contribution to subject identifiability. We find that head motion, as well as heart rate and breathing fluctuations, induce artifactual connectivity within distinct resting-state networks and that they correlate with recurrent patterns in time-varying {FC}.

We demonstrate the potential of the approach using human {fMRI} data during movie-watching data and a continuous experimental paradigm. The model was able to learn spatiotemporal patterns that supported 15-way movie-clip classification (∼90\%) at the level of brain regions, and binary classification of experimental conditions (∼60\%) at the level of voxels. The model was also able to learn individual differences in measures of fluid intelligence and verbal {IQ} at levels comparable to that of existing techniques. We propose a dimensionality reduction approach that uncovers low-dimensional trajectories and captures essential informational (i.e., classification related) properties of brain dynamics. Finally, saliency maps and lesion analysis were employed to characterize brain-region/voxel importance, and uncovered how dynamic but consistent changes in {fMRI} activation influenced decoding performance. When applied at the level of voxels, our framework implements a dynamic version of multivariate pattern analysis. Our approach provides a framework for visualizing, analyzing, and discovering dynamic spatially distributed brain representations during naturalistic conditions.}

abstract = {Developing sensitive and reliable methods to distinguish normal and abnormal brain states is a key neuroscientific challenge. Topological Data Analysis, despite its relative novelty, already generated many promising applications, including in neuroscience. We conjecture its prominent tool of persistent homology may benefit from going beyond analysing structural and functional connectivity to effective connectivity graphs capturing the direct causal interactions or information flows. Therefore, we assess the potential of persistent homology to directed brain network analysis by testing its discriminatory power in two distinctive examples of disease-related brain connectivity alterations: epilepsy and schizophrenia. We estimate connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiology data, employ Persistent Homology and quantify its ability to distinguish healthy from diseased brain states by applying a support vector machine to features quantifying persistent homology structure. We show how this novel approach compares to classification using standard undirected approaches and original connectivity matrices. In the schizophrenia classification, topological data analysis generally performs close to random, while classifications from raw connectivity perform substantially better; potentially due to topographical, rather than topological, specificity of the differences. In the easier task of seizure discrimination from scalp electroencephalography data, classification based on persistent homology features generally reached comparable performance to using raw connectivity, albeit with typically smaller accuracies obtained for the directed (effective) connectivity compared to the undirected (functional) connectivity. Specific applications for topological data analysis may open when direct comparison of connectivity matrices is unsuitable - such as for intracranial electrophysiology with individual number and location of measurements. While standard homology performed overall better than directed homology, this could be due to notorious technical problems of accurate effective connectivity estimation. Copyright \copyright 2021.

abstract = {Network-based representations have introduced a revolution in neuroscience, expanding the understanding of the brain from the activity of individual regions to the interactions between them. This augmented network view comes at the cost of high dimensionality, which hinders both our capacity of deciphering the main mechanisms behind pathologies, and the significance of any statistical and/or machine learning task used in processing this data. A link selection method, allowing to remove irrelevant connections in a given scenario, is an obvious solution that provides improved utilization of these network representations. In this contribution we review a large set of statistical and machine learning link selection methods and evaluate them on real brain functional networks. Results indicate that most methods perform in a qualitatively similar way, with {NBS} (Network Based Statistics) winning in terms of quantity of retained information, {AnovaNet} in terms of stability and {ExT} (Extra Trees) in terms of lower computational cost. While machine learning methods are conceptually more complex than statistical ones, they do not yield a clear advantage. At the same time, the high heterogeneity in the set of links retained by each method suggests that they are offering complementary views to the data. The implications of these results in neuroscience tasks are finally discussed.}

Network models of the brain have become an important tool of modern neurosciences to study fundamental organizational principles of brain structure \& function. Their connectivity is captured by the so-called connectome, the complete set of structural and functional links of the network. Advancing current methodology remains an important need in the field; e.g., increasing large-scale models; incorporating multimodal information in multiplex graph models; dealing with dynamical aspects of network models; and matching data-driven and theoretical models. These challenges form multiple opportunities to develop and adapt emerging signal processing theories and methods at the interface of graph theory, machine learning, applied statistics, simulation, and so on, to play a key role in analysis and modeling and to bring our understanding of brain networks to the next level for key applications in cognitive and clinical neurosciences, including brain-computer interfaces.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) are associated with complex changes as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. To date, neuroimaging-based models are not able to characterize individuals with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Further, although evidence shows that {ADHD} traits occur in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and autism spectrum disorder traits in individuals with {ADHD}, the neurofunctional basis of the overlap is undefined. {METHODS}: Using individuals from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and {ADHD}-200, we apply a data-driven, subject-level approach, connectome-based predictive modeling, to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to identify brain-behavior associations that are predictive of symptom severity. We examine cross-diagnostic commonalities and differences. {RESULTS}: Using leave-one-subject-out and split-half analyses, we define networks that predict Social Responsiveness Scale, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and {ADHD} Rating Scale scores and confirm that these networks generalize to novel subjects. Networks share minimal overlap of edges (\textless 2\%) but some common regions of high hubness (Brodmann areas 10, 11, and 21, cerebellum, and thalamus). Further, predicted Social Responsiveness Scale scores for individuals with {ADHD} are linked to {ADHD} symptoms, supporting the hypothesis that brain organization relevant to autism spectrum disorder severity shares a component associated with attention in {ADHD}. Predictive connections and high-hubness regions are found within a wide range of brain areas and across conventional networks. {CONCLUSIONS}: An individual's functional connectivity profile contains information that supports dimensional, nonbinary classification in autism spectrum disorder and {ADHD}. Furthermore, we can determine disorder-specific and shared neurofunctional pathology using our method. Copyright \copyright 2019 Society of Biological Psychiatry. Published by Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Neuroimaging studies typically adopt a common feature space for all data, which may obscure aspects of neuroanatomy only observable in subsets of a population, e.g. cortical folding patterns unique to individuals or shared by close relatives. Here, we propose to model individual variability using a distinctive keypoint signature: a set of unique, localized patterns, detected automatically in each image by a generic saliency operator. The similarity of an image pair is then quantified by the proportion of keypoints they share using a novel Jaccard-like measure of set overlap. Experiments demonstrate the keypoint method to be highly efficient and accurate, using a set of 7536 T1-weighted {MRIs} pooled from four public neuroimaging repositories, including twins, non-twin siblings, and 3334 unique subjects. All same-subject image pairs are identified by a similarity threshold despite confounds including aging and neurodegenerative disease progression. Outliers reveal previously unknown data labeling inconsistencies, demonstrating the usefulness of the keypoint signature as a computational tool for curating large neuroimage datasets.

Whether or not heterogeneity at the neural level plays a functional role remains unclear, and has been relatively little explored in models which are often highly homogeneous. We compared the performance of spiking neural networks trained to carry out tasks of real-world difficulty, with varying degrees of heterogeneity, and found that heterogeneity substantially improved task performance. Learning with heterogeneity was more stable and robust, particularly for tasks with a rich temporal structure. In addition, the distribution of neuronal parameters in the trained networks is similar to those observed experimentally. We suggest that the heterogeneity observed in the brain may be more than just the byproduct of noisy processes, but rather may serve an active and important role in allowing animals to learn in changing environments. \copyright 2021.

The results indicate the existence of a Pareto optimal front, a triangle whose vertices correspond to archetypal proteins specialized in distinct tasks, such as regulatory processes, membrane transport, outer-membrane pore formation, catalysis, and binding. The vertices are further enriched with proteins that occupy different subcellular compartments, namely, cytoplasmic, inner membrane, outer membrane, and outer membrane bounded periplasmic space. The combination of various enriching features offers an interpretation of how bacteria use the physico-chemical properties of proteins, both to drive them into their final destination in the cell and to have their tasks accomplished.}

abstract = {The organization of interactions in complex systems can be described by networks connecting different units. These graphs are useful representations of the local and global complexity of the underlying systems. The origin of their topological structure can be diverse, resulting from different mechanisms including multiplicative processes and optimization. In spatial networks or in graphs where cost constraints are at work, as it occurs in a plethora of situations from power grids to the wiring of neurons in the brain, optimization plays an important part in shaping their organization. In this paper we study network designs resulting from a Pareto optimization process, where different simultaneous constraints are the targets of selection. We analyze three variations on a problem, finding phase transitions of different kinds. Distinct phases are associated with different arrangements of the connections, but the need of drastic topological changes does not determine the presence or the nature of the phase transitions encountered. Instead, the functions under optimization do play a determinant role. This reinforces the view that phase transitions do not arise from intrinsic properties of a system alone, but from the interplay of that system with its external constraints.}

While rest still dominates in many subfields, data from tasks have empirically demonstrated benefits, as well as the potential to provide insights about the mind in addition to the brain.

abstract = {Graph models of the brain hold great promise as a framework to study functional and structural brain connectivity across scales and species. The network-based statistic ({NBS}) is a well-known tool for performing statistical inference on brain graphs, which controls the family-wise error rate in a mass univariate analysis by combining the cluster-based permutation technique and the graph-theoretical concept of connected components. As the {NBS} is based on group-level inference statistics, it does not inherently enable informed decisions at the level of individuals, which is, however, necessary for the realm of precision medicine. Here we introduce {NBS}-Predict, a new approach that combines the powerful features of machine learning ({ML}) and the {NBS} in a user-friendly graphical user interface ({GUI}). By combining {ML} models with connected components in a cross-validation ({CV}) structure, the new methodology provides a fast and convenient tool to identify generalizable neuroimaging-based biomarkers. The purpose of this paper is to (i) introduce {NBS}-Predict and evaluate its performance using two sets of simulated data with known ground truths, (ii) demonstrate the application of {NBS}-Predict in a real case-control study, including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) data acquired from patients with schizophrenia, (iii) evaluate {NBS}-Predict using rs-{fMRI} data from the Human Connectome Project 1200 subjects release. We found that: (i) {NBS}-Predict achieved good statistical power on two sets of simulated data; (ii) {NBS}-Predict classified schizophrenia with an accuracy of 90\% using subjects' functional connectivity matrices and identified a subnetwork with reduced connections in the group with schizophrenia, mainly comprising brain regions localized in frontotemporal, visual, and motor areas, as well as in the subcortex; (iii) {NBS}-Predict also predicted general intelligence scores from resting-state {fMRI} connectivity matrices with a prediction score of r = 0.2 and identified a large-scale subnetwork associated with general intelligence. Overall results showed that {NBS}-Predict performed comparable to or better than pre-existing feature selection algorithms (lasso, elastic net, top 5\%, p-value thresholding) and connectome-based predictive modeling ({CPM}) in terms of identifying relevant features and prediction accuracy.

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study examined the concurrent diagnostic validity of the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism ({\SSAGA}) across alcohol and drug dependencies, major depression, anxiety disorders and {ASPD}. The Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry ({SCAN}) was selected as the comparison instrument because it arises from a different tradition and uses a different format for its administration. The {SCAN} has been shown to be valid and applicable cross-culturally. {METHOD}: Subjects included 38 men and 42 women volunteers from another study and from an outpatient psychiatry clinic. Selected sections of both the {\SSAGA} and the {SCAN} interviews were administered to all subjects, approximately 1 week apart, in a randomized order. Because the {SCAN} does not assess Antisocial Personality Disorder ({ASPD}), the {ASPD} section of the Structured Clinical Interview for {DSM}-{III}-R ({SCID}) was substituted for this comparison. {RESULTS}: The Kappa statistic was used to measure concordance between the two instruments. Kappa for alcohol dependence was in the acceptable range (0.63). Kappas were lower for sedative dependence (0.48) and for cannabis dependence (0.53), but higher for cocaine and stimulant dependence (0.85) and for opioid dependence (0.73). Kappa for major depression and the {ASPD} diagnoses were high (0.71 and 0.70), but slightly lower agreement was found for panic disorder (0.62). Kappa for social phobia was 0.47. {CONCLUSION}: These data, combined with results from two previous studies which examined reliability, indicate that the {\SSAGA} is a highly reliable and valid instrument for use in studies of a variety of psychiatric disorders, including alcohol and drug dependence.}

abstract = {Neuroimaging data is being increasingly utilized to address questions of individual difference. When examined with task-related {fMRI} (t-{fMRI}), individual differences are typically investigated via correlations between the {BOLD} activation signal at every voxel and a particular behavioral measure. This can be problematic because: 1) correlational designs require evaluation of t-{fMRI} psychometric properties, yet these are not well understood; and 2) bivariate correlations are severely limited in modeling the complexities of brain-behavior relationships. Analytic tools from psychometric theory such as latent variable modeling (e.g., structural equation modeling) can help simultaneously address both concerns. This review explores the advantages gained from integrating psychometric theory and methods with cognitive neuroscience for the assessment and interpretation of individual differences. The first section provides background on classic and modern psychometric theories and analytics. The second section details current approaches to t-{fMRI} individual difference analyses and their psychometric limitations. The last section uses data from the Human Connectome Project to provide illustrative examples of how t-{fMRI} individual differences research can benefit by utilizing latent variable models.

abstract = {With the maturation of metabolomics science and proliferation of biobanks, clinical metabolic profiling is an increasingly opportunistic frontier for advancing translational clinical research. Automated Machine Learning ({AutoML}) approaches provide exciting opportunity to guide feature selection in agnostic metabolic profiling endeavors, where potentially thousands of independent data points must be evaluated. In previous research, {AutoML} using high-dimensional data of varying types has been demonstrably robust, outperforming traditional approaches. However, considerations for application in clinical metabolic profiling remain to be evaluated. Particularly, regarding the robustness of {AutoML} to identify and adjust for common clinical confounders. In this study, we present a focused case study regarding {AutoML} considerations for using the Tree-Based Optimization Tool ({TPOT}) in metabolic profiling of exposure to metformin in a biobank cohort. First, we propose a tandem rank-accuracy measure to guide agnostic feature selection and corresponding threshold determination in clinical metabolic profiling endeavors. Second, while {AutoML}, using default parameters, demonstrated potential to lack sensitivity to low-effect confounding clinical covariates, we demonstrated residual training and adjustment of metabolite features as an easily applicable approach to ensure {AutoML} adjustment for potential confounding characteristics. Finally, we present increased homocysteine with long-term exposure to metformin as a potentially novel, non-replicated metabolite association suggested by {TPOT}; an association not identified in parallel clinical metabolic profiling endeavors. While warranting independent replication, our tandem rank-accuracy measure suggests homocysteine to be the metabolite feature with largest effect, and corresponding priority for further translational clinical research. Residual training and adjustment for a potential confounding effect by {BMI} only slightly modified the suggested association. Increased homocysteine is thought to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency - evaluation for potential clinical relevance is suggested. While considerations for clinical metabolic profiling are recommended, including adjustment approaches for clinical confounders, {AutoML} presents an exciting tool to enhance clinical metabolic profiling and advance translational research endeavors.}

abstract = {Biological Ecosystem Networks ({BENs}) are webs of biological species (nodes) establishing trophic relationships (links). Experimental confirmation of all possible links is difficult and generates a huge volume of information. Consequently, computational prediction becomes an important goal. Artificial Neural Networks ({ANNs}) are Machine Learning ({ML}) algorithms that may be used to predict {BENs}, using as input Shannon entropy information measures (Shk) of known ecosystems to train them. However, it is difficult to select a priori which {ANN} topology will have a higher accuracy. Interestingly, Auto Machine Learning ({AutoML}) methods focus on the automatic selection of the more efficient {ML} algorithms for specific problems. In this work, a preliminary study of a new approach to {AutoML} selection of {ANNs} is proposed for the prediction of {BENs}. We call it the Net-Net {AutoML} approach, because it uses for the first time Shk values of both networks involving {BENs} (networks to be predicted) and {ANN} topologies (networks to be tested). Twelve types of classifiers have been tested for the Net-Net model including linear, Bayesian, trees-based methods, multilayer perceptrons and deep neuronal networks. The best Net-Net {AutoML} model for 338,050 outputs of 10 {ANN} topologies for links of 69 {BENs} was obtained with a deep fully connected neuronal network, characterized by a test accuracy of 0.866 and a test {AUROC} of 0.935. This work paves the way for the application of Net-Net {AutoML} to other systems or {ML} algorithms.}

abstract = {The mainstream method used for the analysis of task functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) data, is to obtain task-related active brain regions based on generalized linear models. Machine learning as a data-driven technical method is increasingly used in {fMRI} data analysis. The language task data, including math task and story task, of the Human Connectome Project ({HCP}) was used in this work. We chose a linear support vector machine as a classifier to classify math and story tasks and compared them with the activated brain regions of a {SPM} statistical analysis. As a result, 13 of the 25 regions used for classification in {SVM} were activated regions, and 12 were non-activated regions. In particular, the right Paracentral Lobule and right Rolandic Operculum which belong to non-activated regions, contributed most to the classification. Therefore, the differences found in machine learning can provide a new understanding of the physiological mechanisms of brain regions under different tasks.}

abstract = {A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is deciphering the representational schemes of the brain. Stimulus-feature-based encoding models are becoming increasingly popular for inferring the dimensions of neural representational spaces from stimulus-feature spaces. We argue that such inferences are not always valid because successful prediction can occur even if the two representational spaces use different, but correlated, representational schemes. We support this claim with three simulations in which we achieved high prediction accuracy despite systematic differences in the geometries and dimensions of the underlying representations. Detailed analysis of the encoding models' predictions showed systematic deviations from ground-truth, indicating that high prediction accuracy is insufficient for making representational inferences. This fallacy applies to the prediction of actual neural patterns from stimulus-feature spaces and we urge caution in inferring the nature of the neural code from such methods. We discuss ways to overcome these inferential limitations, including model comparison, absolute model performance, visualization techniques and attentional modulation.

abstract = {Functional connectivity ({FC}) estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) signals is important in understanding neural representation and information processing in cortical networks. However, due to a lack of "ground truth" {FC} pattern, the reliability and robustness of {FC} estimates are usually examined in downstream {FC} analysis tasks, such as performing participant's identification (also known as "fingerprinting"). In this paper, we propose to learn {FC} via a smooth graph learning framework. In particular, we treat each time frame of the {fMRI} time series as a graph signal on an underlying functional brain graph, and estimate the smooth graph functional connectivity ({SGFC}) by learning the weighted graph adjacency matrix based on graph signal smoothness assumption. We demonstrate that our approach gives rise to a natural and sparse graph representation of {FC} from which reliable graph measures can be extracted. Reliability of {SGFC} is evaluated in the context of fingerprinting and compared to correlation {FC} ({CFC}). {SGFC} achieves higher fingerprinting accuracy across several different experiment settings; the improvement is even more significant when a shorter {fMRI} scanning length is used for {FC} estimation. In addition to being reliable, we also validate the cognitive relevance of {SGFC} by using it to predict fluid intelligence. Finally, in evaluating topological measures of the sparse graph, {SGFC} reveals a more small-world and modular structure compared to {CFC}. Together, our results suggest that the smooth graph learning framework produces a naturally sparse, reliable, and cognitive-relevant representation of functional connectivity.

The {AutoML} setting differs from former model selection/hyper-parameter selection challenges, such as the one we previously organized for {NIPS} 2006: the participants aim to develop fully automated and computationally efficient systems, capable of being trained and tested without human intervention, with code submission. This chapter analyzes the results of these competitions and provides details about the datasets, which were not revealed to the participants. The solutions of the winners are systematically benchmarked over all datasets of all rounds and compared with canonical machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn.

abstract = {A key goal in neuroscience is to understand the brain mechanisms of cognitive functions. An emerging approach is brain decoding , which consists of inferring a set of experimental conditions performed by a participant, using pattern classification of brain activity. Few works so far have attempted to train a brain decoding model that would generalize across many different cognitive tasks drawn from multiple cognitive domains. To tackle this problem, we proposed a domain-general brain decoder that automatically learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain response within a short time window using a deep learning approach. By leveraging our prior knowledge on network organization of human brain cognition, we constructed deep graph convolutional neural networks to annotate cognitive states by first mapping the task-evoked {fMRI} response onto a brain graph, propagating brain dynamics among interconnected brain regions and functional networks, and generating state-specific representations of recorded brain activity. We evaluated the decoding model on a large population of 1200 participants, under 21 different experimental conditions spanning 6 different cognitive domains, acquired from the Human Connectome Project task-{fMRI} database. Using a 10s window of {fMRI} response, the 21 cognitive states were identified with a test accuracy of 89\% (chance level 4.8\%). Performance remained good when using a 6s window (82\%). It was even feasible to decode cognitive states from a single {fMRI} volume (720ms), with the performance following the shape of the hemodynamic response. Moreover, a saliency map analysis demonstrated that the high decoding performance was driven by the response of biologically meaningful brain regions. Together, we provide an automated tool to annotate human brain activity with fine temporal resolution and fine cognitive granularity. Our model shows potential applications as a reference model for domain adaptation, possibly making contributions in a variety of domains, including neurological and psychiatric disorders.}

To be effective in practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters. Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning ({AutoML}) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods. Building on this, we introduce a robust new {AutoML} system based on scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to a structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters). This system, which we dub {AUTO}-{SKLEARN}, improves on existing {AutoML} methods by automatically taking into account past performance on similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models evaluated during the optimization. Our system won the first phase of the ongoing {ChaLearn} {AutoML} challenge, and our comprehensive analysis on over 100 diverse datasets shows that it substantially outperforms the previous state of the art in {AutoML}. We also demonstrate the performance gains due to each of our contributions and derive insights into the effectiveness of the individual components of {AUTO}-{SKLEARN}.},

We develop {PoSH} Auto-sklearn, which enables {AutoML} systems to work well on large datasets under rigid time limits using a new, simple and meta-feature-free meta-learning technique and employs a successful bandit strategy for budget allocation. However, {PoSH} Auto-sklearn introduces even more ways of running {AutoML} and might make it harder for users to set it up correctly. Therefore, we also go one step further and study the design space of {AutoML} itself, proposing a solution towards truly hands-free {AutoML}. Together, these changes give rise to the next generation of our {AutoML} system, Auto-sklearn 2.0 . We verify the improvements by these additions in a large experimental study on 39 {AutoML} benchmark datasets and conclude the paper by comparing to other popular {AutoML} frameworks and Auto-sklearn 1.0 , reducing the relative error by up to a factor of 4.5, and yielding a performance in 10 minutes that is substantially better than what Auto-sklearn 1.0 achieves within an hour.}

Using the two methods to shuffle the neuronal network in systematic ways, the edge exchange and the vertex swapping, we show that positions of neurons are not randomly distributed but organized to reduce the wiring cost. Furthermore, we discuss the trade-off between the wiring cost and the performance of the network.}

abstract = {Functional connectivity ({FC}) networks are typically inferred from resting-state {fMRI} data using the Pearson correlation between {BOLD} time series from pairs of brain regions. However, alternative methods of estimating functional connectivity have not been systematically tested for their sensitivity or robustness to head motion artifact. Here, we evaluate the sensitivity of eight different functional connectivity measures to motion artifact using resting-state data from the Human Connectome Project. We report that {FC} estimated using full correlation has a relatively high residual distance-dependent relationship with motion compared to partial correlation, coherence, and information theory-based measures, even after implementing rigorous methods for motion artifact mitigation. This disadvantage of full correlation, however, may be offset by higher test-retest reliability, fingerprinting accuracy, and system identifiability. {FC} estimated by partial correlation offers the best of both worlds, with low sensitivity to motion artifact and intermediate system identifiability, with the caveat of low test-retest reliability and fingerprinting accuracy. We highlight spatial differences in the sub-networks affected by motion with different {FC} metrics. Further, we report that intra-network edges in the default mode and retrosplenial temporal sub-networks are highly correlated with motion in all {FC} methods. Our findings indicate that the method of estimating functional connectivity is an important consideration in resting-state {fMRI} studies and must be chosen carefully based on the parameters of the study.

abstract = {The topology of structural brain networks shapes brain dynamics, including the correlation structure of brain activity (functional connectivity) as estimated from functional neuroimaging data. Empirical studies have shown that functional connectivity fluctuates over time, exhibiting patterns that vary in the spatial arrangement of correlations among segregated functional systems. Recently, an exact decomposition of functional connectivity into frame-wise contributions has revealed fine-scale dynamics that are punctuated by brief and intermittent episodes (events) of high-amplitude cofluctuations involving large sets of brain regions. Their origin is currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that similar episodes readily appear in silico using computational simulations of whole-brain dynamics. As in empirical data, simulated events contribute disproportionately to long-time functional connectivity, involve recurrence of patterned cofluctuations, and can be clustered into distinct families. Importantly, comparison of event-related patterns of cofluctuations to underlying patterns of structural connectivity reveals that modular organization present in the coupling matrix shapes patterns of event-related cofluctuations. Our work suggests that brief, intermittent events in functional dynamics are partly shaped by modular organization of structural connectivity. Copyright \copyright 2021 the Author(s).

abstract = {Given the high prevalence and associated cost of chronic pain, it has a significant impact on individuals and society. Improvements in the treatment and management of chronic pain may increase patients\textquoteright quality of life and reduce societal costs. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in chronic pain research. A literature search was conducted using the {PubMed}, {IEEE} Xplore, and the Association of Computing Machinery ({ACM}) Digital Library databases. Relevant studies were identified by screening titles and abstracts for keywords related to chronic pain and machine learning, followed by analysing full texts. Two hundred and eighty-seven publications were identified in the literature search. In total, fifty-three papers on chronic pain research and machine learning were reviewed. The review showed that while many studies have emphasised machine learning-based classification for the diagnosis of chronic pain, far less attention has been paid to the treatment and management of chronic pain. More research is needed on machine learning approaches to the treatment, rehabilitation, and self-management of chronic pain. As with other chronic conditions, patient involvement and self-management are crucial. In order to achieve this, patients with chronic pain need digital tools that can help them make decisions about their own treatment and care.}

abstract = {Communication within the brain is dynamic. Chronic pain can also be dynamic, with varying intensities experienced over time. Little is known of how brain dynamics are disrupted in chronic pain, or relates to patients' pain assessed at various timescales (eg, short-term state vs long-term trait). Patients experience pain "traits" indicative of their general condition, but also pain "states" that vary day to day. Here, we used network-based multivariate machine learning to determine how patterns in dynamic and static brain communication are related to different characteristics and timescales of chronic pain. Our models were based on resting-state dynamic functional connectivity ({dFC}) and static functional connectivity in patients with chronic neuropathic pain ({NP}) or non-{NP}. The most prominent networks in the models were the default mode, salience, and executive control networks. We also found that cross-network measures of {dFC} rather than static functional connectivity were better associated with patients' pain, but only in those with {NP} features. These associations were also more highly and widely associated with measures of trait rather than state pain. Furthermore, greater dynamic connectivity with executive control networks was associated with milder {NP}, but greater dynamic connectivity with limbic networks was associated with greater {NP}. Compared with healthy individuals, the {dFC} features most highly related to trait {NP} were also more abnormal in patients with greater pain. Our findings indicate that {dFC} reflects patients' overall pain condition (ie, trait pain), not just their current state, and is impacted by complexities in pain features beyond intensity.}

abstract = {Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent health problems in the world today, yet neurological markers, critical to diagnosis of chronic pain, are still largely unknown. The ability to objectively identify individuals with chronic pain using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data is important for the advancement of diagnosis, treatment, and theoretical knowledge of brain processes associated with chronic pain. The purpose of our research is to investigate specific neurological markers that could be used to diagnose individuals experiencing chronic pain by using multivariate pattern analysis with {fMRI} data. We hypothesize that individuals with chronic pain have different patterns of brain activity in response to induced pain. This pattern can be used to classify the presence or absence of chronic pain. The {fMRI} experiment consisted of alternating 14 seconds of painful electric stimulation (applied to the lower back) with 14 seconds of rest. We analyzed contrast {fMRI} images in stimulation versus rest in pain-related brain regions to distinguish between the groups of participants: 1) chronic pain and 2) normal controls. We employed supervised machine learning techniques, specifically sparse logistic regression, to train a classifier based on these contrast images using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. We correctly classified 92.3\% of the chronic pain group (N = 13) and 92.3\% of the normal control group (N = 13) by recognizing multivariate patterns of activity in the somatosensory and inferior parietal cortex. This technique demonstrates that differences in the pattern of brain activity to induced pain can be used as a neurological marker to distinguish between individuals with and without chronic pain. Medical, legal and business professionals have recognized the importance of this research topic and of developing objective measures of chronic pain. This method of data analysis was very successful in correctly classifying each of the two groups.}

abstract = {The spontaneous brain activity exhibits long-range spatial correlations detected using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) signals in newborns when (1) long neuronal pathways are still developing, and (2) the electrical brain activity consists of developmentally unique, intermittent events believed to guide activity-dependent brain wiring. We studied this spontaneous electrical brain activity using multichannel electroencephalography ({EEG}) of premature and fullterm babies during sleep to assess the development of spatial integration during last months of gestation. Correlations of frequency-specific amplitudes were found to follow a robust bimodality: During low amplitudes (low mode), brain activity exhibited very weak spatial correlations. In contrast, the developmentally essential high-amplitude events (high mode) showed strong spatial correlations. There were no clear spatial patterns in the early preterm, but clear frontal and parieto-occipital modules at term age. A significant fronto-occipital gradient was also seen in the development of the graph measure clustering coefficient. Strikingly, no bimodality was found in the {fMRI} recordings of the fullterm babies, suggesting that early {EEG} activity and {fMRI} signal reflect different mechanisms of spatial coordination. The results are compatible with the idea that early developing human brain exhibits intermittent long-range spatial connections that likely provide the endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks. \copyright The Author 2013.

We discuss how varying degrees and kinds of flexibility may be adaptive (or maladaptive) in different contexts, specifically focusing on measures related to either more disjoint or cohesive dynamics. While disjointed flexibility may be useful for assessing neural entropy, cohesive flexibility may potentially serve as a proxy for self-organized criticality as a fundamental property enabling adaptive behavior in complex systems. Particular attention is given to recent studies in which flexibility methods have been used to investigate neurological and cognitive maturation, as well as the breakdown of conscious processing under varying levels of anesthesia. We further discuss how these findings and methods might be contextualized within the Free Energy Principle with respect to the fundamentals of brain organization and biological functioning more generally, and describe potential methodological advances from this paradigm. Finally, with relevance to computational psychiatry, we propose a research program for obtaining a better understanding of ways that dynamic networks may relate to different forms of psychological flexibility, which may be the single most important factor for ensuring human flourishing.

abstract = {Recent work identified single time points (\textquotedblleftevents\textquotedblright) of high regional cofluctuation in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) which contain more large-scale brain network information than other, low cofluctuation time points. This suggested that events might be a discrete, temporally sparse signal which drives functional connectivity ({FC}) over the timeseries. However, a different, not yet explored possibility is that network information differences between time points are driven by sampling variability on a constant, static, noisy signal. Using a combination of real and simulated data, we examined the relationship between cofluctuation and network structure and asked if this relationship was unique, or if it could arise from sampling variability alone. First, we show that events are not discrete – there is a gradually increasing relationship between network structure and cofluctuation; ∼50\% of samples show very strong network structure. Second, using simulations we show that this relationship is predicted from sampling variability on static {FC}. Finally, we show that randomly selected points can capture network structure about as well as events, largely because of their temporal spacing. Together, these results suggest that, while events exhibit particularly strong representations of static {FC}, there is little evidence that events are unique timepoints that drive {FC} structure. Instead, a parsimonious explanation for the data is that events arise from a single static, but noisy, {FC} structure. {HIGHLIGHTS}: Past results suggested high cofluctuation {BOLD} \textquotedblleftevents\textquotedblright drive {fMRI} functional connectivity, {FC} Here, events were examined in both real {fMRI} data and a stationary null model to test this model In real data, \textgreater50\% of {BOLD} timepoints show high modularity and similarity to time-averaged {FC} Stationary null models identified events with similar behavior to real data Events may not be a transient driver of static {FC}, but rather an expected outcome of it.}

abstract = {In the last two decades, there has been an explosion of interest in modeling the brain as a network, where nodes correspond variously to brain regions or neurons, and edges correspond to structural or statistical dependencies between them. This kind of network construction, which preserves spatial, or structural, information while collapsing across time, has become broadly known as "network neuroscience." In this work, we provide an alternative application of network science to neural data: network-based analysis of non-linear time series and review applications of these methods to neural data. Instead of preserving spatial information and collapsing across time, network analysis of time series does the reverse: it collapses spatial information, instead preserving temporally extended dynamics, typically corresponding to evolution through some kind of phase/state-space. This allows researchers to infer a, possibly low-dimensional, "intrinsic manifold" from empirical brain data. We will discuss three methods of constructing networks from nonlinear time series, and how to interpret them in the context of neural data: recurrence networks, visibility networks, and ordinal partition networks. By capturing typically continuous, non-linear dynamics in the form of discrete networks, we show how techniques from network science, non-linear dynamics, and information theory can extract meaningful information distinct from what is normally accessible in standard network neuroscience approaches.

Regions of the basal ganglia are extensively interconnected with the cortex via reciprocal connections that relay and modulate cortical function. Here we employ an edge-centric approach, which computes co-fluctuations among region pairs in a network to investigate the role and interaction of subcortical regions with cortical systems. By clustering edges into communities, we show that cortical systems and subcortical regions couple via multiple edge communities, with hippocampus and amygdala having a distinct pattern from striatum and thalamus. We show that the edge community structure of cortical networks is highly similar to one obtained from cortical nodes when the subcortex is present in the network. Additionally, we show that the edge community profile of both cortical and subcortical nodes can be estimates solely from cortico-subcortical interactions. Finally, we used a motif analysis focusing on edge community triads where a subcortical region coupled to two cortical regions and found that two community triads where one community couples the subcortex to the cortex were overrepresented. In summary, our results show organized coupling of the subcortex to the cortex that may play a role in cortical organization of primary sensorimotor/attention and heteromodal systems and puts forth the motif analysis of edge community triads as a promising method for investigation of communication patterns in networks.

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity is typically modeled as the correlation structure of whole-brain regional activity. It is studied widely, both to gain insight into the brain's intrinsic organization but also to develop markers sensitive to changes in an individual's cognitive, clinical, and developmental state. Despite this, the origins and drivers of functional connectivity, especially at the level of densely sampled individuals, remain elusive. Here, we leverage novel methodology to decompose functional connectivity into its precise framewise contributions. Using two dense sampling datasets, we investigate the origins of individualized functional connectivity, focusing specifically on the role of brain network "events" - short-lived and peaked patterns of high-amplitude cofluctuations. Here, we develop a statistical test to identify events in empirical recordings. We show that the patterns of cofluctuation expressed during events are repeated across multiple scans of the same individual and represent idiosyncratic variants of template patterns that are expressed at the group level. Lastly, we propose a simple model of functional connectivity based on event cofluctuations, demonstrating that group-averaged cofluctuations are suboptimal for explaining participant-specific connectivity. Our work complements recent studies implicating brief instants of high-amplitude cofluctuations as the primary drivers of static, whole-brain functional connectivity. Our work also extends those studies, demonstrating that cofluctuations during events are individualized, positing a dynamic basis for functional connectivity. Copyright \copyright 2022.

abstract = {We propose that the application of network theory to established psychological personality conceptions has great potential to advance a biologically plausible model of human personality. Stable behavioral tendencies are conceived as personality "traits." Such traits demonstrate considerable variability between individuals, and extreme expressions represent risk factors for psychological disorders. Although the psychometric assessment of personality has more than hundred years tradition, it is not yet clear whether traits indeed represent "biophysical entities" with specific and dissociable neural substrates. For instance, it is an open question whether there exists a correspondence between the multilayer structure of psychometrically derived personality factors and the organizational properties of traitlike brain systems. After a short introduction into fundamental personality conceptions, this article will point out how network neuroscience can enhance our understanding about human personality. We will examine the importance of intrinsic (task-independent) brain connectivity networks and show means to link brain features to stable behavioral tendencies. Questions and challenges arising from each discipline itself and their combination are discussed and potential solutions are developed. We close by outlining future trends and by discussing how further developments of network neuroscience can be applied to personality research. \copyright 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.}

Describing {dFC} as a flow across morphing connectivity configurations, our notion of {dFC} speed quantifies the rate at which {FC} networks evolve in time. Here we probe the hypothesis that variations of rs {dFC} speed and cognitive performance are selectively interrelated within specific functional subnetworks. In particular, we focus on Sleep Deprivation ({SD}) as a reversible model of cognitive dysfunction. We found that whole-brain level (global) {dFC} speed significantly slows down after 24h of {SD}. However, the reduction in global {dFC} speed does not correlate with variations of cognitive performance in individual tasks, which are subtle and highly heterogeneous. On the contrary, we found strong correlations between performance variations in individual tasks -including Rapid Visual Processing ({RVP}, assessing sustained visual attention)- and {dFC} speed quantified at the level of functional sub-networks of interest. Providing a compromise between classic static {FC} (no time) and global {dFC} (no space), modular {dFC} speed analyses allow quantifying a different speed of {dFC} reconfiguration independently for sub-networks overseeing different tasks. Importantly, we found that {RVP} performance robustly correlates with the modular {dFC} speed of a characteristic frontoparietal module. Copyright \copyright 2020 The Author(s).

The motivation behind this research is to find generalizable neuromarkers of cognitive functions. However, insufficient prediction accuracies and long scan time requirements are still unsolved issues. Here we propose a new machine learning algorithm for predicting intelligence scores of healthy human subjects from resting state ({rsfMRI}) or task-based {fMRI} ({tfMRI}). In a cohort of 390 unrelated test subjects of the Human Connectome Project, we found correlations between the observed and the predicted general intelligence of more than 50 percent in {tfMRI}, and of around 59 percent when results from two tasks are combined. Surprisingly, we found that the {tfMRI} data were significantly more predictive of intelligence than {rsfMRI} even though they were acquired at much shorter scan times (approximately 10 minutes versus 1 hour). Existing methods that we investigated in a benchmark comparison underperformed on {tfMRI} data and produced prediction accuracies well below our results. Our proposed algorithm differs from existing methods in that it achieves dimensionality reduction via ensemble learning and partial least squares regression rather than via brain parcellations or {ICA} decompositions. In addition, it introduces Ricci-Forman curvature as a novel type of edge weight.}

The common approach to estimate {tvFC} uses sliding windows and offers limited temporal resolution. An alternative method is to use the recently proposed edge-centric approach, which enables the tracking of moment-to-moment changes in co-fluctuation patterns between pairs of brain regions. Here, we first examined the dynamic features of edge time series and compared them to those in the sliding window {tvFC} (sw-{tvFC}). Then, we used edge time series to compare subjects with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) and healthy controls ({CN}). Our results indicate that relative to sw-{tvFC}, edge time series captured rapid and bursty network-level fluctuations that synchronize across subjects during movie-watching. The results from the second part of the study suggested that the magnitude of peak amplitude in the collective co-fluctuations of brain regions (estimated as root sum square ({R\SS}) of edge time series) is similar in {CN} and {ASD}. However, the trough-to-trough duration in {R\SS} signal is greater in {ASD}, compared to {CN}. Furthermore, an edge-wise comparison of high-amplitude co-fluctuations showed that the within-network edges exhibited greater magnitude fluctuations in {CN}. Our findings suggest that high-amplitude co-fluctuations captured by edge time series provide details about the disruption of functional brain dynamics that could potentially be used in developing new biomarkers of mental disorders.}

abstract = {The non-stationarity of resting-state brain activity has received increasing attention in recent years. Functional connectivity ({FC}) analysis with short sliding windows and coactivation pattern ({CAP}) analysis are two widely used methods for assessing the dynamic characteristics of brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). However, the statistical nature of the dynamics captured by these techniques needs to be verified. In this study, we found that the results of {CAP} analysis were similar for real {fMRI} data and simulated stationary data with matching covariance structures and spectral contents. We also found that, for both the real and simulated data, {CAPs} were clustered into spatially heterogeneous modules. Moreover, for each of the modules in the real data, a spatially similar module was found in the simulated data. The present results suggest that care needs to be taken when interpreting observations drawn from {CAP} analysis as it does not necessarily reflect non-stationarity or a mixture of states in resting brain activity.

abstract = {Inference in neuroimaging commonly occurs at the level of "clusters" of neighboring voxels or connections, thought to reflect functionally specific brain areas. Yet increasingly large studies reveal effects that are shared throughout the brain, suggesting that reported clusters may only reflect the "tip of the iceberg" of underlying effects. Here, we empirically compare power of traditional levels of inference (edge and cluster) with broader levels of inference (network and whole-brain) by resampling functional connectivity data from the Human Connectome Project (n=40, 80, 120). Only network- and whole brain-level inference attained or surpassed "adequate" power ( \beta =80\%) to detect an average effect, with almost double the power for network- compared with cluster-level procedures at more typical sample sizes. Likewise, effects tended to be widespread, and more widespread pooling resulted in stronger magnitude effects. Power also substantially increased when controlling {FDR} rather than {FWER}. Importantly, there may be similar implications for task-based activation analyses where effects are also increasingly understood to be widespread. However, increased power with broader levels of inference may diminish the specificity to localize effects, especially for non-task contexts. These findings underscore the benefit of shifting the scale of inference to better capture the underlying signal, which may unlock opportunities for discovery in human neuroimaging.}

abstract = {There is an ongoing debate as to whether cognitive processes arise from a group of functionally specialized brain modules (modularism) or as the result of a distributed nonlinear process (dynamical systems theory). The former predicts that tasks that recruit similar brain areas should have an equivalent degree of similarity in their connectivity. The latter allows for differential connectivity, even when the areas recruited are largely the same. Here we evaluated both views by comparing activation and connectivity patterns from a large sample of healthy subjects (N=242) that performed two executive control tasks, color-word Stroop task and Multi-Source Interference Task ({MSIT}), known to recruit similar brain areas. Using a measure of instantaneous connectivity based on edge time series as outcome variables, we estimated task-related network profiles as connectivity changes between incongruent and congruent information conditions. The degree of similarity of such profiles at the group level between both tasks was substantially smaller than their overlapping activation responses. A similar finding was observed at the subject level and when employing a different method for defining task-related connectivity. Our results are consistent with the perspective of the brain as a dynamical system, suggesting that task representations should be understood at both node and edge (connectivity) levels. {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}: There exist two contrasting views of the brain that yield different predictions of how cognition is represented. In the modular view, similar cognitive processes should have similar connectivity profiles. In contrast, a dynamical systems view allows for multiple network configurations in these situations. Here we tested both views using two tasks, color-word Stroop and Multi-Source Interference Task ({MSIT}), that evoke a similar brain response. Using a novel approach of instantaneous connectivity we first estimated the connectivity changes during both tasks and subsequently found that their similarity was substantially smaller than the patterns of brain activation. These findings reinforce the view of brain as a dynamical system and shed light onto how cognitive processes may be quantitatively modeled.}

However, the time scales of human brain identifiability are still largely unexplored. We here investigate the dynamics of brain fingerprints along two complementary axes: (i) What is the optimal time scale at which brain fingerprints integrate information and (ii) when best identification happens. Using dynamic identifiability, we show that the best identification emerges at longer time scales; however, short transient \textquotedblleftbursts of identifiability,\textquotedblright associated with neuronal activity, persist even when looking at shorter functional interactions. Furthermore, we report evidence that different parts of connectome fingerprints relate to different time scales, i.e., more visual-somatomotor at short temporal windows and more frontoparietal-{DMN} driven at increasing temporal windows. Last, different cognitive functions appear to be meta-analytically implicated in dynamic fingerprints across time scales. We hope that this investigation will advance our understanding of what makes our brains unique.}

Previous studies have focused on characterizing the properties of high-amplitude frames, including their cluster structure. Less is known about middle- and low-amplitude co-fluctuations. Here, we address those questions directly, using data from two dense-sampling studies: the {MyConnectome} project and Midnight Scan Club. We develop a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group peak co-fluctuations of all magnitudes into nested and multi-scale clusters based on their pairwise concordance. At a coarse scale, we find evidence of three large clusters that, collectively, engage virtually all canonical brain systems. At finer scales, however, each cluster is dissolved, giving way to increasingly refined patterns of co-fluctuations involving specific sets of brain systems. We also find an increase in global co-fluctuation magnitude with hierarchical scale. Finally, we comment on the amount of data needed to estimate co-fluctuation pattern clusters and implications for brain-behavior studies. Collectively, the findings reported here fill several gaps in current knowledge concerning the heterogeneity and richness of co-fluctuation patterns as estimated with edge time series while providing some practical guidance for future studies.}

The purpose of the present study was to explore whether such relationship exists using combined functional {MRI} and positron emission tomography ({PET}) measurements of glucose uptake. {METHODS}: Functional and metabolic imaging data from 25 right-handed healthy human adults (aged 18-23 years, 18 females) were analyzed. Measures, including average resting state functional connectivity ({FC}) with respect to 82 Brodmann areas, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ({FALFF}), and average fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG}) uptake by {PET}, were computed for 48 predefined {WM} bundles. Pearson correlations across the bundles and 25 subjects studied were calculated among these measures. Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate the variance explainable by a predictor variable in the absence of inter-subject variations. {RESULTS}: Analysis of six separate imaging intervals found that average {FC} the bundles was significantly correlated with local {FDG} uptake (r = 0.25, p \textless  0.001), and the {FC} also covaried significantly with {FALFF} (r = 0.41, p \textless  0.001). When random effects from inter-subject variations were controlled, these correlations appeared to be medium to strong (r = 0.41 for {FC} vs. {FDG} uptake, and r = 0.65 for {FALFF} vs. {FC}). {CONCLUSION}: This study indicates that {BOLD} signals in {WM} are directly related to variations in metabolic demand and engagement with cortical processing and suggests they should be incorporated into more complete models of brain function. \copyright 2021 The Authors.

One method that harnesses such individual signatures is functional connectome fingerprinting, which can reliably identify individuals from large study populations. However, the precise relationship between functional signatures underlying fingerprinting and behavioural prediction remains unclear. Expanding on previous reports, here we systematically investigate the link between discrimination and prediction on different levels of brain network organisation (individual connections, network interactions, topographical organisation, and connection variability). Our analysis revealed a substantial divergence between discriminatory and predictive connectivity signatures on all levels of network organisation. Across different brain parcellations, thresholds, and prediction algorithms, we find discriminatory connections in higher-order multimodal association cortices, while neural correlates of behaviour display more variable distributions. Furthermore, we find the standard deviation of connections between participants to be significantly higher in fingerprinting than in prediction, making inter-individual connection variability a possible separating marker. These results demonstrate that participant identification and behavioural prediction involve highly distinct functional systems of the human connectome. The present study thus calls into question the direct functional relevance of connectome fingerprints. \copyright 2022. The Author(s).}

abstract = {Prenatal opioid exposure has been linked to adverse effects spanning multiple neurodevelopmental domains, including cognition, motor development, attention, and vision. However, the neural basis of these abnormalities is largely unknown. A total of 49 infants, including 21 opioid-exposed and 28 controls, were enrolled and underwent {MRI} (43 ± 6 days old) after birth, including resting state functional {MRI}. Edge-centric functional networks based on dynamic functional connections were constructed, and machine-learning methods were employed to identify neural features distinguishing opioid-exposed infants from unexposed controls. An accuracy of 73.6\% (sensitivity 76.25\% and specificity 69.33\%) was achieved using 10 times 10-fold cross-validation, which substantially outperformed those obtained using conventional static functional connections (accuracy 56.9\%). More importantly, we identified that prenatal opioid exposure preferentially affects inter- rather than intra-network dynamic functional connections, particularly with the visual, subcortical, and default mode networks. Consistent results at the brain regional and connection levels were also observed, where the brain regions and connections associated with visual and higher order cognitive functions played pivotal roles in distinguishing opioid-exposed infants from controls. Our findings support the clinical phenotype of infants exposed to opioids in utero and may potentially explain the higher rates of visual and emotional problems observed in this population. Finally, our findings suggested that edge-centric networks could better capture the neural differences between opioid-exposed infants and controls by abstracting the intrinsic co-fluctuation along edges, which may provide a promising tool for future studies focusing on investigating the effects of prenatal opioid exposure on neurodevelopment. \copyright The Author(s) 2022.

Spontaneous neural activity is constrained by this architecture, giving rise to patterns of statistical dependencies between the activity of remote neural elements. The non-trivial relationship between structural and functional connectivity poses many unsolved challenges about cognition, disease, development, learning and aging. While numerous studies have focused on statistical relationships between edge weights in anatomical and functional networks, less is known about dependencies between their modules and communities. In this work, we investigate and characterize the relationship between anatomical and functional modular organization of the human brain, developing a novel multi-layer framework that expands the classical concept of multi-layer modularity optimization. By simultaneously mapping anatomical and functional networks estimated from different subjects into communities, this approach allows us to carry out a multi-subject and multi-modal analysis of the brain\textquoterights modular organization. Here, we investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional modules during resting state, finding unique and shared structures. The proposed framework constitutes a methodological advance in the context of multi-layer network analysis and paves the way to further investigate the relationship between structural and functional network organization in clinical cohorts, during cognitively demanding tasks, and in developmental or lifespan studies.}

Most prior work has focused on spatial features (nodes and systems) of these {FC} fingerprints, computed over entire imaging sessions. We propose a method for temporally filtering {FC}, which allows selecting specific moments in time while also maintaining the spatial pattern of node-based activity. To this end, we leverage a recently proposed decomposition of {FC} into edge time series ({eTS}). We systematically analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging frames to define features that enhance identifiability across multiple fingerprinting metrics, similarity metrics, and data sets. Results show that these metrics characteristically vary with {eTS} cofluctuation amplitude, similarity of frames within a run, transition velocity, and expression of functional systems. We further show that data-driven optimization of features that maximize fingerprinting metrics isolates multiple spatial patterns of system expression at specific moments in time. Selecting just 10\% of the data can yield stronger fingerprints than are obtained from the full data set. Our findings support the idea that {FC} fingerprints are differentially expressed across time and suggest that multiple distinct fingerprints can be identified when spatial and temporal characteristics are considered simultaneously. \copyright The Author(s) 2022.

The brain's large-scale organization can be divided into two broad categories: zero-lag representations of functional connectivity structure and time-lag representations of traveling wave or propagation structure. In this study, we sought to unify observed phenomena across these two categories in the form of three low-frequency spatiotemporal patterns composed of a mixture of standing and traveling wave dynamics. We showed that a range of empirical phenomena, including functional connectivity gradients, the task-positive/task-negative anti-correlation pattern, the global signal, time-lag propagation patterns, the quasiperiodic pattern and the functional connectome network structure, are manifestations of these three spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns account for much of the global spatial structure that underlies functional connectivity analyses and unifies phenomena in resting-state functional {MRI} previously thought distinct. \copyright 2022.
