abstract = {In the twentieth century, the dominant model of sexual differentiation stated that genetic sex ({XX} versus {XY}) causes differentiation of the gonads, which then secrete gonadal hormones that act directly on tissues to induce sex differences in function. This serial model of sexual differentiation was simple, unifying and seductive. Recent evidence, however, indicates that the linear model is incorrect and that sex differences arise in response to diverse sex-specific signals originating from inherent differences in the genome and involve cellular mechanisms that are specific to individual tissues or brain regions. Moreover, sex-specific effects of the environment reciprocally affect biology, sometimes profoundly, and must therefore be integrated into a realistic model of sexual differentiation. A more appropriate model is a parallel-interactive model that encompasses the roles of multiple molecular signals and pathways that differentiate males and females, including synergistic and compensatory interactions among pathways and an important role for the environment.}

In order to study such cortical properties in humans, it is necessary to obtain an accurate and explicit representation of the cortical surface in individual subjects. Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical surface, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual intervention. Automated routines for unfolding and flattening the cortical surface are described in a companion paper.

We demonstrate dynamic changes in brain connectivity over the timescales of days to months, and relations between brain connectivity, gene expression and metabolites.

abstract = {The amplitudes of spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity may be a significant source of within-subject and between-subject variability, and this variability is likely to be carried through into functional connectivity ({FC}) estimates (whether directly or indirectly). Therefore, improving our understanding of amplitude fluctuations over the course of a resting state scan and variation in amplitude across individuals is of great relevance to the interpretation of {FC} findings. We investigate resting state amplitudes in two large-scale studies ({HCP} and {UK} Biobank), with the aim of determining between-subject and within-subject variability. Between-subject clustering distinguished between two groups of brain networks whose amplitude variation across subjects were highly correlated with each other, revealing a clear distinction between primary sensory and motor regions ('primary sensory/motor cluster') and cognitive networks. Within subjects, all networks in the primary sensory/motor cluster showed a consistent increase in amplitudes from the start to the end of the scan. In addition to the strong increases in primary sensory/motor amplitude, a large number of changes in {FC} were found when comparing the two scans acquired on the same day ({HCP} data). Additive signal change analysis confirmed that all of the observed {FC} changes could be fully explained by changes in amplitude. Between-subject correlations in {UK} Biobank data showed a negative correlation between primary sensory/motor amplitude and average sleep duration, suggesting a role of arousal. Our findings additionally reveal complex relationships between amplitude and head motion. These results suggest that network amplitude is a source of significant variability both across subjects, and within subjects on a within-session timescale. Future {rfMRI} studies may benefit from obtaining arousal-related (self report) measures, and may wish to consider the influence of amplitude changes on measures of (dynamic) functional connectivity.

Despite a rapidly growing body of literature, however, functional connectivity research has yet to deliver biomarkers that can aid psychiatric diagnosis or prognosis at the single-subject level. One impediment to developing such practical tools has been uncertainty regarding the ratio of intra- to interindividual variability in functional connectivity; in other words, how much variance is state- versus trait-related. Here, we review recent evidence that functional connectivity profiles are both reliable within subjects and unique across subjects, and that features of these profiles relate to behavioral phenotypes. Together, these results suggest the potential to discover reliable correlates of present and future illness and/or response to treatment in the strength of an individual's functional brain connections. Ultimately, this work could help develop personalized approaches to psychiatric illness.}

abstract = {The utility and success of resting-state functional connectivity {MRI} (rs-{fcMRI}) depend critically on the reliability of this technique and the extent to which it accurately reflects neuronal function. One challenge is that rs-{fcMRI} is influenced by various sources of noise, particularly cardiac- and respiratory-related signal variations. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the impact of various physiological noise correction techniques, specifically those that use independent cardiac and respiration measures, on the test-retest reliability of rs-{fcMRI}. A group of 25 subjects were each scanned at three time points--two within the same imaging session and another 2-3 months later. Physiological noise corrections accounted for significant variance, particularly in blood vessels, sagittal sinus, cerebrospinal fluid, and gray matter. The fraction of variance explained by each of these corrections was highly similar within subjects between sessions, but variable between subjects. Physiological corrections generally reduced intrasubject (between-session) variability, but also significantly reduced intersubject variability, and thus reduced the test-retest reliability of estimating individual differences in functional connectivity. However, based on known nonneuronal mechanisms by which cardiac pulsation and respiration can lead to {MRI} signal changes, and the observation that the physiological noise itself is highly stable within individuals, removal of this noise will likely increase the validity of measured connectivity differences. Furthermore, removal of these fluctuations will lead to better estimates of average or group maps of connectivity. It is therefore recommended that studies apply physiological noise corrections but also be mindful of potential correlations with measures of interest.}

A better characterization of the features underlying successful fingerprinting performance-how many and which functional connections are necessary and/or sufficient for high accuracy-will further inform our understanding of uniqueness in brain functioning. Thus, here we examine the limits of high-accuracy individual identification from functional connectomes. Using ∼3,300 scans from the Human Connectome Project in a split-half design and an independent replication sample, we find that a remarkably small "thin slice" of the connectome-as few as 40 out of 64,620 functional connections-was sufficient to uniquely identify individuals. Yet, we find that no specific connections or even specific networks were necessary for identification, as even small random samples of the connectome were sufficient. These results have important conceptual and practical implications for the manifestation and detection of uniqueness in the brain.}

Here, we report on a new study designed to either better differentiate {ASD} from {TD} functional connectomes-or, alternatively, to refine our understanding of the factors underlying the current state of affairs. We scanned individuals with {ASD} and controls both at rest and while watching videos with social content. Using multiband {fMRI} across repeat sessions, we improved both data quantity and scanning duration by collecting up to 2 hr of data per individual. This is about 50 times the typical number of temporal samples per individual in {ASD} {fcMRI} studies. We obtained functional connectomes that were discriminable, allowing for near-perfect individual identification regardless of diagnosis, and equally reliable in both groups. However, contrary to what one might expect, we did not consistently or robustly observe in the {ASD} group either reductions in similarity to {TD} functional connectivity ({FC}) patterns or shared atypical {FC} patterns. Accordingly, {FC}-based predictions of diagnosis group achieved accuracy levels around chance. However, using the same approaches to predict scan type (rest vs. video) achieved near-perfect accuracy. Our findings suggest that neither the limitations of resting state as a "task," data resolution, data quantity, or scan duration can be considered solely responsible for failures to differentiate {ASD} from {TD} functional connectomes. \copyright 2020 The Authors.

abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) methods are increasingly being used to predict pathologies and biological traits using neuroimaging data. Here controlling for confounds is essential to get unbiased estimates of generalization performance and to identify the features driving predictions. However, a systematic evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of available alternatives is lacking. This makes it difficult to compare results across studies and to build deployment quality models. Here, we evaluated two commonly used confound removal schemes–whole data confound regression ({WDCR}) and cross-validated confound regression ({CVCR})–to understand their effectiveness and biases induced in generalization performance estimation. Additionally, we study the interaction of the confound removal schemes with Z-score normalization, a common practice in {ML} modelling. We applied eight combinations of confound removal schemes and normalization (pipelines) to decode sex from resting-state functional {MRI} ({rfMRI}) data while controlling for two confounds, brain size and age. We show that both schemes effectively remove linear univariate and multivariate confounding effects resulting in reduced model performance with {CVCR} providing better generalization estimates, i.e., closer to out-of-sample performance than {WDCR}. We found no effect of normalizing before or after confound removal. In the presence of dataset and confound shift, four tested confound removal procedures yielded mixed results, raising new questions. We conclude that {CVCR} is a better method to control for confounding effects in neuroimaging studies. We believe that our in-depth analyses shed light on choices associated with confound removal and hope that it generates more interest in this problem instrumental to numerous applications.}

In this study, we thus address how the parameters of diffusion-weighted data processing for structural connectivity ({SC}) can influence the validation results of the whole-brain mathematical models informed by {SC}. For this, we introduce a set of simulation conditions including the varying number of total streamlines of the whole-brain tractography ({WBT}) used for extraction of {SC}, cortical parcellations based on functional and anatomical brain properties and distinct model fitting modalities. The main objective of this study is to explore how the quality of the model validation can vary across the considered simulation conditions. We observed that the graph-theoretical network properties of structural connectome can be affected by varying tractography density and strongly relate to the model performance. We also found that the optimal number of the total streamlines of {WBT} can vary for different brain atlases. Consequently, we suggest a way how to improve the model performance based on the network properties and the optimal parameter configurations from multiple {WBT} conditions. Furthermore, the population of subjects can be stratified into subgroups with divergent behaviors induced by the varying {WBT} density such that different recommendations can be made with respect to the data processing for individual subjects and brain parcellations.

To answer this question, we capitalize on a large data sample from the Human Connectome Project and rigorously investigate the contribution of the aforementioned processes on functional connectivity ({FC}) and time-varying {FC}, as well as their contribution to subject identifiability. We find that head motion, as well as heart rate and breathing fluctuations, induce artifactual connectivity within distinct resting-state networks and that they correlate with recurrent patterns in time-varying {FC}. Even though the spatiotemporal signatures of these processes yield above-chance levels in subject identifiability, removing their effects at the preprocessing stage improves identifiability, suggesting a neural component underpinning the inter-individual differences in connectivity. \copyright 2021, Xifra-Porxas et al.}

Our exposition also constitutes a critique of the existing edge-centric studies, showing that their main findings can be derived from the {nFC} under a static null hypothesis that disregards temporal correlations. Testing the analytic predictions on functional {MRI} data from the Human Connectome Project confirms that the {nFC} can explain most variation in the edge {FC} matrix, the edge communities, the large cofluctuations, and the corresponding spatial patterns.

abstract = {Functional connectivity ({FC}) profiles contain subject-specific features that are conserved across time and have potential to capture brain-behavior relationships. Most prior work has focused on spatial features (nodes and systems) of these {FC} fingerprints, computed over entire imaging sessions. We propose a method for temporally filtering {FC}, which allows selecting specific moments in time while also maintaining the spatial pattern of node-based activity. To this end, we leverage a recently proposed decomposition of {FC} into edge time series ({eTS}). We systematically analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging frames to define features that enhance identifiability across multiple fingerprinting metrics, similarity metrics, and data sets. Results show that these metrics characteristically vary with {eTS} cofluctuation amplitude, similarity of frames within a run, transition velocity, and expression of functional systems. We further show that data-driven optimization of features that maximize fingerprinting metrics isolates multiple spatial patterns of system expression at specific moments in time. Selecting just 10\% of the data can yield stronger fingerprints than are obtained from the full data set. Our findings support the idea that {FC} fingerprints are differentially expressed across time and suggest that multiple distinct fingerprints can be identified when spatial and temporal characteristics are considered simultaneously. \copyright The Author(s) 2022.

Many scienti c elds however realized the shortcomings of frequentist reasoning and in the most radical cases even banned its use in publications. We should do the same: just as we have embraced the Bayesian paradigm in the development of new machine learning methods, so we should also use it in the analysis of our own results. We argue for abandonment of {NHST} by exposing its fallacies and, more importantly, oer better\textbarmore sound and useful\textbaralternatives for it.}

abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) has yielded seemingly disparate insights into large-scale organization of the human brain. The brain's large-scale organization can be divided into two broad categories: zero-lag representations of functional connectivity structure and time-lag representations of traveling wave or propagation structure. In this study, we sought to unify observed phenomena across these two categories in the form of three low-frequency spatiotemporal patterns composed of a mixture of standing and traveling wave dynamics. We showed that a range of empirical phenomena, including functional connectivity gradients, the task-positive/task-negative anti-correlation pattern, the global signal, time-lag propagation patterns, the quasiperiodic pattern and the functional connectome network structure, are manifestations of these three spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns account for much of the global spatial structure that underlies functional connectivity analyses and unifies phenomena in resting-state functional {MRI} previously thought distinct. \copyright 2022.
